  <h3><a href="/2009/04/06/fridays-coming.html">Friday's Coming.</a></h3>
  <p><p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2012:20-36&amp;version=31">John 12:20-36</a> is intense.  It's a piece of the New Testament  I haven't spent much time studying, but I looked over it tonight in honor of Holy Week.  Easter is coming, and in this passage, no one is more aware of it than Jesus.</p>
<p>When I first looked through Jesus' words and reactions here, it didn't make sense to me.  His words didn't seem to fit together.  And I had no idea why the voice of God would make such a sudden intrusion at such a seemingly innocuous moment.  But it does make sense.</p>
<p>Look at verses 23 and 24.  Jesus knows he has to die to fulfill his purpose on earth.  And he's not looking forward to it (verse 27).  Even so, "Father, glorify your name."  That's his choice.  To make the sacrifice for us, knowing the pain he has yet to endure.  This is no small moment.</p>
<p><em>Then  a voice came from heaven: "I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again." The crowd that stood there and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said,  "An angel has spoken to him." Jesus answered,  "This voice has come for your sake, not mine." -</em>John 12:28-30 (ESV)</p>
<p>There's a lot to celebrate this week, in which God displayed His humility and love.

  <h3><a href="/2009/04/05/messenger-destination.html">The Messenger: Destination</a></h3>
  <p><p>The thought distantly occurred to Phelps that he had not technically completed the baptism ceremony.  He hadn’t had the time to speak his line - <span style="font-style: italic;">so do I </span>- before the command hit him.  <span style="font-style: italic;">North</span>, said the voice, and north he went.  When the crowds thickened, his run slowed to a very fast walk, dodging between pedestrians and cutting through alleys.</p>

  <p><p>Just checked in at the Best Western in Covina - pardon me, West  <br />Covina. Elizabeth and I are attending a seminar on forming faith-based  <br />nonprofit organizations.  That's right. My church sent me out of town  <br />for a seminar. Not only that, but I'm headed to Anaheim in a few weeks  <br />for a conference for work.&lt;p&gt;This is my first experience with business travel. I'm glad I had E to  <br />talk to on the way down. My sympathy to those who are on the road a  <br />lot alone.&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's just the novelty, but a hotel room has a certain mystique.  <br />A room where no one lives. Where someone else just was.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/04/03/by-your-love.html">By Your Love</a></h3>
  <p><p>In Jordan, publicly preaching the Christian faith is illegal.  This we learned from two missionary friends who gave us a presentation in Bible study last night.  They've lived in the Middle East for two years, now, and have met with some success in their mission.</p>
<p>How?  By openly defying the Jordanian government and boldly preaching the Word on every streetcorner? I mean, really, isn't that what missionaries are supposed to do?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>They make friends.  They get involved in the community.  They serve in the local Arab Christian church.  They love people, and take care of people.  And when the opportunity arises to speak openly about Jesus, when someone asks a question about faith or requests an Arabic copy of the Bible... they do.</p>
<p>They've discovered in a new way the power of Christian fellowship.  Of people just loving one another and serving God across cultures, races, and national boundaries.  I'm glad for their example.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/04/01/not-so-hopeless.html">Not So Hopeless</a></h3>
  <p><p>A little over five years ago, this is <a href="http://razorclown.blogspot.com/2004/02/i-should-clarify-my-previous-two-posts.html">what I was thinking</a>:</p>
<p>"I used to be a hopeless romantic. Turns out that part of that deal is being hopeless. "</p>
<p>I spent years stomping on my romantic side, and it's messed with my perspective.  What seemed to me like wisdom at the time was obviously just an expression of lonely bitterness.  I reacted, not to the perfectly normal desire to find a soulmate, but to the painful desperation I felt at the time to find someone.  For too long, they were the same thing to me.</p>
<p>It's taken me years of personal growth and prayer, but I'm finally able to separate the two.  To be honest, romantic affection apart from intense heartache is still kind of a new idea for me.  I'm still making a few mental adjustments.</p>
<p>But, thank God, I'm learning what it's supposed to be like.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/30/messenger-instructions.html">The Messenger: Instructions</a></h3>
  <p><p>"You knew I was coming," Phelps finally said.</p>
<p>Deacon Mariah smiled, the tiny creases between the thin plates of her face stretching apart.  "A dream," she said, her wispy voice purring over the "r" sound.  "Yeshua's angel."</p>
<p>On the transport had been a congregation of New Lunar Baptists.  After listening to their ravings over the long trip, he had almost gotten used to hearing the Christ called Jesus, rather than Yeshua.  Mariah spoke the name carefully, with reverence.  A far cry, as it were, from the proselytizers on the ship.</p>
<p>Phelps could already tell that Mariah spoke English only with great effort.  But a half-N'aaa priestess in this city...  "Wrri, ihhi tchaun'eh an hal," he said in Nrru.  <em>She told me to come to you.</em></p>
<p>Mariah drew her head back in a serpentine motion, again expressing her surprise.  "And she told me to baptize you," she said simply, in unaccented Nrru.  Even as she spoke, she knelt down and took a handful of green-blue sand.</p>
<p>Phelps froze.  "I... wait..."</p>
<p>The deaconess fixed her blank gaze on him, her hand held high, gently trickling sand.  "It is unbefitting a prophet to be unbaptized.  Will you submit to it?"  She drew herself up, facing him directly.</p>
<p>"I'm not... look, the last time..."</p>
<p>Her hand was suddenly on his chest.  For a moment, he forgot that it was a common N'aaa gesture of friendship.  "Yeshua knows your fears," she was saying.  Gently.  "And he says to you this: you did not leave me there.  I went after you from that place."</p>
<p>The chapel, back in Phoenix.  The guilt.  He was there again.  But now, with her words - with his words - the weight of the memory evaporated.  All at once.  Gone.</p>
<p><em>Oh, Lord...</em> "I will submit to it," Phelps breathed.</p>
<p>Mariah did not hesitate for even a moment.  Phelps' chest tightened as her hand drifted over his shoulders and head, pouring a trail of sand.  "You have one Lord," she said.  "What is his name?"</p>
<p>"Yeshua."  The sand settled on him, and with it, a strange calm.  He held still.</p>
<p>Silence.  In the quiet, the noise of the city far distant, he lost track of time.  Only three seconds passed, but Phelps felt every moment before she spoke again.  "And as he died, so have you," Mariah intoned.  "And..."  She stopped, took a gasp of air.  He could have sworn he heard her giggle.  "And as he lives...."</p>
<p>In response, Phelps tilted his head and leaned back, spilling the sand down his back.  He had barely enough time to register his suprise at how easy the ceremony was after all before the sensation hit.</p>
<p>It was a voice, but not audible.  A compulsion, but not irresistable.  A certainty.  A call.  A command.</p>
<p><em>North</em>.</p>
<p>Phelps hesitated for only an instant.  "Which way is north?" he demanded in Nrru.</p>
<p>Deacon Mariah pointed, and he ran.</p>

<p>I am more keenly aware now of how what I post here represents me, particularly now that I'm employed by the church.  It's tempting to put disclaimers on all my opinions now, especially after Jen grilled/teased me about some of my earlier views on <a href="http://razorclown.blogspot.com/2003/04/love-is-bad-word.html">love</a>.  Heh.</p>
<p>I might have to go through the archives and see what the heck I've gotten myself into.</p>

<p>The mere existence of overstuffed breakfast pizza is not enough to cause the downfall of Western civilization. Oh, no.&lt;p&gt;The fact that I’m happy to pay three bucks for it, eat the whole thing, and wash it down with black coffee? That doesn’t bode well.&lt;p&gt;See the orange in the background? That makes that mass of protein and starch in the foreground part of a balanced breakfast.</p>

<p>In this picture are a few things that I just decided will decorate my new office at church. In the background, an encouraging note written to me by Greg Hogan, an awesome man who helped form my young faith. On the left, two paper cranes, folded by Lindsey Ballard for a classmate with cancer. Little symbols of love and hope, with an Asian flair, no less.&lt;p&gt;The cross on the foreground was also a gift, specifically to decorate the office. It quotes Jeremiah 29:11-13 - to which I was specifically guided recently - and Psalm 32:8. Featured prominently is the word “Journey,” which is not only a great reminder that I am a work in progress, but also reminds me of Sojourn. A perfect gift.&lt;p&gt;From my girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll be hearing more about this girl. For now, I’ll say this: her name is Jen, and she’s amazing.&lt;p&gt;Today turned out to be pretty good after all.</p>
