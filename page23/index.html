  <p><p>18  “Hear then the parable of the sower: 19 When anyone hears the word of  the kingdom and  does not understand it,  the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path. 20 As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately  receives it with joy, 21 yet he has no root in himself, but  endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately  he falls away. 22 As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but  the cares of  the world and  the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. 23 As for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and  understands it. He indeed  bears fruit and yields, in one case  a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.” </p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/09/overcome.html">Overcome</a></h3>
  <p><p>There are a few stories in the Bible I can hardly finish telling without choking up.</p>
<p>Jesus took two of his disciples, two of his closest friends, up on a mountaintop with him.  There, the Bible says that as they watch, Jesus illuminates, literally glowing, and two long-dead prophets appear to speak with him.  Completely awestruck and terrified, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%209:5-6;&amp;version=31;">words fail</a>.  The men are surrounded by a cloud, from which the voice of God the Father boom.  Then, silence.  They look around.  Just Jesus.  In my mind, this is where Jesus grins and starts walking nonchalantly down the hill, then looks over his shoulder at them and says, "Well?  You coming?"</p>
<p>Here's the part of the story where I have trouble talking.</p>
<p>They get to the bottom of the hill, and they hear arguing.  There's a man there, with his son.  The religious leaders and <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Jesus'</span> followers are shouting back and forth, but when they see Jesus, they come running.  It turns out the man brought his son to <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Jesus'</span> disciples to be healed of his seizures.  The disciples tried, and failed.  As Jesus watches, the boy falls to the ground, convulsing violently.  In the midst of all the turmoil, with the crowd looking on, the father says, "If you can do anything, take pity on us and help us."</p>
<p>"If?" Jesus says.  He tells him, "Everything is possible for him who believes."</p>
<p>Here is the father's response, as recorded in Mark 9:24:</p>
<p><em>Immediately the boy's father exclaimed, "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"</em></p>
<p>That's me.  I know that place.</p>
<p>If you've ever had your trust betrayed, you know.  If you've ever been wearied by disappointment, you know.  If you've been reduced to hope without expectation, you know what he meant.  If you've been given every reason to doubt, you understand.</p>
<p>So, what does Jesus do with this man?  With this broken, hopeless, desperate man?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%209:24-27;&amp;version=31;">He grants both his requests</a>.</p>
<p>I pray we never stop at doubt.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/07/plot-twists.html">Plot Twists</a></h3>
  <p><p>These days, I consistently feel a little shock of panic when I see the date.  Time is always moving forward a little too fast.  I think I would be less fearful if I had better time management skills.</p>
<p>Today, all I really did was read <em>Watchmen</em>.  Cody loaned me his copy late last night, and I got a few pages in before a late bedtime.  Got up nice and late, and my mid-afternoon, I was well over halfway through.  Running out of a few household essentials - food among them - necessitated a trip to the store, which required me to change out of my PJs.</p>
<p>With my nightly Bible reading a blog post still to do, I was closing in on the ending when the phone rang.  Turns out the person who was going to teach Sunday School tomorrow is sick, and in the end, it fell to me to prepare something for tomorrow morning.  With a small number of teachers available and the number of things we have going on - Sunday School, children's ministry, and a mission committee meeting - situations like this will arise very occasionally.</p>
<p>Michael tells us to keep something ready to teach, just in case.  "Have something in your pocket" is how he puts it.  When the call came, I thought I had nothing.  After a browse through my journals and notes, however, a plan has formed.  Those few minutes of panic, however, called me to account.</p>
<p>So, I'm going to work on translating whatever mental discipline allows me to read an inch-thick graphic novel in a day into my study time, my devotions, and my prayers.  I already have that kind of focus in one area, and I want it in another.  I'll be working on that.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/07/dude-who-shot-me.html">Dude, Who Shot Me?</a></h3>
  <p><p>Once again, the boys gathered at Pastor Holmes' place to play Call of Duty on the XBox. This is the second time just recently that I've had a laugh-out-loud good time with a group of guy friends pretending to shoot each other. The girls tend to leave the room.</p>
<p>The Call of Duty series, and other games like it, offers two things guys love: violence and competition. There's some odd appeal to launching a grenade far across a field to land at your friend's feet, who you didn't even see, but who would have done the same to you if he had the chance. I also appreciate that while the games have big, loud guns, the gore is quite minimal. The latest installment ramps it up quite a bit, but it's still fantasy violence, where only your pride gets hurt when you get shotgunned.</p>
<p>Really, it's not to be overthought. It's just dang fun.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/05/tonight-was-another-amazing-night-at.html">Of Dogs</a></h3>
  <p><p>Tonight was another amazing night at Bible study.  Ashley’s lesson was out of <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark%207:24-30;&amp;version=31;">Mark 7:24-30</a>, one of the most challenging passages in the Bible.  In it, Jesus miraculously heals a pagan woman’s daughter because she comes to him with extreme humility.  It’s a very deep story, with a lot of cultural and historical subtleties - which, in the context of the original story, weren’t subtle at all.  We focused mainly on two ideas: that Jesus offends the proud, but shows mercy on the humble.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Sacramento is situated midway between Mexico and Canada on I-5, which is one reason why so many slaves move through the city.</p>
<p>I didn't know.  I thought slavery had been eradicated from the world in the 19th century.  I thought the days were long past when parents sold their daughters into brothels, and people were kidnapped and forced to work without pay.  And until tonight, I thought that by far, most of the people in the sex industry were there voluntarily.</p>
<p>Tonight, my church held a human trafficking information night.  The statistics are horrific.  One estimate from the International Labor Organization places the number of human beings enslaved at this moment at 12.3 million.  We saw pictures of a sweatshop that was raided in California fifteen years ago.  Looked like a normal apartment complex.  You couldn't see the barbed wire fence from the street, or for that matter, the people who slept fifteen to a room.
</p>
<p>Spreading awareness is only the beginning.  This isn't another issue that will inflame a few people for a moment and then pass from memory.  From everything I've seen, the church is gearing up for a fight.  There are already organizations doing excellent work, and we intend to join them.  Here are a few.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/02/28/whippersnapper.html">Whippersnapper</a></h3>
  <p><p>Sometimes, I feel old for 25.</p>
<p>In stark contrast to a few years ago, there's only one night a week I can reasonably stay up past midnight - Friday, as you might have guessed - and given the option, I often don't.  I've never been a morning person, and I doubt I ever will be, but I have made it work for some time, now.</p>
<p>I was recently part of a discussion about the difference between health and fitness.  To be healthy, the way we typically think of it, is really just to be not-sick.  To be fit is something else altogether, and I can definitely feel the difference.  I'm not dramatically out of shape, but I'm no athlete, either.  Years behind various desks with very minimal exercise in my off hours have seen to that.  One flight of stairs, and my pulse races.  Ten minutes at Sky High, and I need a breather.</p>
<p>I can feel my friendships changing, maybe maturing.  At least, shifting into a more adult mode; that is to say, more occasional.  I just don't see my friends as much as I did in my early college years.  We're all dividing our time between work, school, and at least one other obligation aside from hangout time.  It's normal, but to me, it still seems like a relatively new normal.</p>
<p>I'm getting a sense that I'm entering a time of my life when expectations on me are rising, because of both my age, and my circumstances.  I'm now on staff at my church.  I'm an "analyst" at my day job.  I have more opportunities to make decisions that carry weight.  For whatever reason, that idea also seems relatively novel.</p>
<p>I'm in that odd stage when others, older co-workers especially, alternately treat me like a peer and a youngster.  I still remind women in their forties of their sons, it turns out.  People my parents' age are just now starting to see what my generation is capable of, and some are pretty impressed.  The usual conversation starts out with how easily we pick up technology, then rounds out with how many of us return home in debt.</p>
<p>I've been described as having an "old soul," but I still have some youthful habits and attitudes.  Through it all, my identity is slowly starting to settle.  It can be difficult to accurately track the process from the inside.  If you've got some insight as to how I've changed in recent years, feel free to chime in.</p>
