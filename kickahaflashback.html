    <p>Kickaha sputtered and wiped scummy water from his face as he pulled himself into the doorframe. Somehow, this deep in the ruins, this was the first place the water hadn’t been fresh and clear. How was that possible? They had come across standing water before, but this room was ripe with algae, like an old pond. By comparison, everything else was like a mountain stream.</p>

<p><em>Or a river.</em> Kickaha smiled at the memory.</p>

<hr />

<p>“Why does this one look like you, Tani?” Kickaha asked, pointing to the tattoo on the back of Tanikala’s left hand.</p>

<p>The old woman grinned, chuckling aloud. “I never told you that story?”</p>

<p>Kickaha shook his head and sat down on the rocky shore next to his elder, listening expectantly.</p>

<p>Tanikala stepped out of the stream, tossing the empty fish trap down casually and glancing at the back of her hand. “Well. When I was young, I used to ask ‘why’ about twice a minute, just like you. I thought we were chasing down all these stories and inking them on our bodies so we could understand everything about the whole world.” Her eye sparkled as she threw the young man a look. “That what you think?”</p>

<p>Kickaha nodded uncertainly.</p>

<p>“Well. I thought so until I met myself face to face.” She smirked as Kickaha’s eyes went wide. “Mmm-hmm. Turned around and there I was, looking real scared. Panicked. Had her mouth open like she was trying to tell me something. Know what she said?”</p>

<p>Kickaha shook his head.</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“She tried, but she disappeared. Couldn’t get it out in time.”</p>

<p>“Wh— what did you… do?”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t sleep for a few weeks.” Tanikala sat next to Kickaha on the bank of the stream and folded her legs, graceful for a woman of her age. “Tried to imagine what would scare me so bad I’d go find a younger me to tell about it. Had a couple nightmares about that.” She paused for a sip from her canteen. “Mmm. Then I talked to my elders. They didn’t know. Then I thought about that face staring back at me every day I was out gathering stories. Looked for answers while I was out there. Know what I found?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. Not even a little clue.”</p>

<p>A thousand whys spun through Kickaha’s mind.</p>

<p>“But what did happen is, I saw my reflection one day, and wouldn’t you know it, I was older than that scared little Tani I saw.”</p>

<p>The questions spun faster, multiplying. “Wait, what does that mean?”</p>

<p>Tanikala looked Kickaha straight in the eye and shrugged, smiling gently. “Can’t say.”</p>

<p>“But—”</p>

<p>“Ooh, fish just jumped,” Tanikala said, standing and scooping up the fish trap, leaving Kickaha on the bank. The young man sputtered as the old woman dipped beneath the stream to set the trap.</p>

<p>Kickaha was already yelling when Tanikala surfaced. “But <em>what does that mean?</em>”</p>

<p>The elder wiped her eyes and called back, “The truth is a big river, Kickaha! Trying to understand everything is like trying to hold the whole thing in your hand.” She held up the tattoo of her own face, pointing to it with her right hand. “That’s not why we do this.”</p>

<p>Kickaha cupped his hands. “Then why?”</p>

<p>Tanikala waded back to the shore and held up her canteen. “What we’re trying to do is fill our canteens and get some fish. Get enough truth to sustain us as we go. And always keep coming back for more.”</p>

<p>She ruffled the young man’s hair and laid out to sun herself dry. “You hear that trap spring, you go get our dinner, all right?”</p>

<p>Kickaha stared at the rushing waters, thinking. “Yeah. I’ve got it.”</p>
