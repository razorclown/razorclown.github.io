  <p><p>I remember telling Ashley.  On and around New Year’s, I get a sense of what the year to come will be like.  Strangely, it’s been pretty accurate over the past few years.  A handful of minutes into this year, I remember telling Ashley: this year, long-held dreams will come to pass.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/07/11/reunion.html">Reunion</a></h3>
  <p><p>The field sputtered light, a cloud of particles flashing in waves and sparkles. Edward was surprised, and a little disturbed, at how bright and colorful it was. He looked over at Sandra, the company liaison, with her carefully neutral expression. “How, uh, long does it usually…” And his breath stopped when Joan’s face appeared in the glittering fog.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/04/11/day-40.html">Day 40</a></h3>
  <p><p>Lent is a season of fasting.  The day before Lent begins is, for some, the biggest party of the year.  In New Orleans, they actually change the rules for Mardi Gras; things that are illegal on any other day of the year are allowed on Fat Tuesday.  May as well live it up now, the logic goes, if we're gonna have to be all pious for a month plus.  At least, that's how it started.  Now, people join the party without knowing why.</p>
<p>The entire point of Lent is to remember.  To understand Easter better, and all that leads up to it.  To deliberately draw near to God.  So I think, if we really had the right perspective, the biggest party of the year would start tomorrow.</p>
<p>It's almost Sunday.  When the fasting ends, and the feast begins.  Remember why.  It's worth celebrating.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/04/11/quiet.html">Quiet</a></h3>
  <p><p>Golgotha was quiet, and had been for a day.  The guards and the onlookers had long since departed.  The two dead thieves still hung from their crosses, mouths open as though still in a weary plea for mercy.</p>
<p>Only one desperate soul remained on the hill.  Incensed.  Seething.  Muttering hatefully.</p>
<p>"This isn't over... this is <em>not</em> over...."</p>
<p>But he knew it was.  He knew it was over the moment Jesus said it was.  Finished.  Done.  The moment Jesus cried out and took it all.</p>
<p>Had they seen?  They had to have seen him.  The moment he realized that it wasn't his plan that was coming to pass.  That single moment of shock.</p>
<p>When all the sins of the world piled onto God's only son.  When the hideous blackness descended, and was still not enough to block the Glory blazing out from him.  When Jesus breathed his last, and took it all with him.</p>
<p>When all Satan's work fell apart before his very eyes.</p>
<p>He stared at the ground where the cross had been driven.  There, he caught sight of a stone, spattered with blood.  The blood.</p>
<p>Satan roared.  He then took a long, long moment to steady himself.</p>
<p>"This is <em>not</em> over," he snarled, and stormed from the hill.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/04/09/later-you-will-understand.html">Later You Will Understand</a></h3>
  <p><p>This is where the story begins to take a turn for the worst.</p>
<p>It's a festival in Jerusalem.  The Jews are celebrating the power of God, eating the Passover meal together as families.  Jesus takes it a step further.  He, God himself, stoops low and washes their feet.  He sets for them an example of humility.  And he commands them, "as I have loved you, so you must love one another." (John 13:34)  A mandate.  Hence, Maundy Thursday.</p>
<p>But only hours later, Jesus is in chains.  The apostles are scattered.  Peter, terrified, is denying that he even knows his friend and master.  The only innocent man is on trial, and will soon be unjustly condemned.</p>
<p>Yet, a plan is unfolding.  Older than Rome, older than Earth, and older than time.  In the beginning, Jesus knew this was coming.  And he accepted it willingly.</p>
<p>Remember that tomorrow.  On the most horrific day ever to be called Good.</p>
<p>"Unless I wash you, you have no part with me." -Jesus (John 13:8)</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/04/06/fridays-coming.html">Friday's Coming.</a></h3>
  <p><p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2012:20-36&amp;version=31">John 12:20-36</a> is intense.  It's a piece of the New Testament  I haven't spent much time studying, but I looked over it tonight in honor of Holy Week.  Easter is coming, and in this passage, no one is more aware of it than Jesus.</p>
<p>When I first looked through Jesus' words and reactions here, it didn't make sense to me.  His words didn't seem to fit together.  And I had no idea why the voice of God would make such a sudden intrusion at such a seemingly innocuous moment.  But it does make sense.</p>
<p>Look at verses 23 and 24.  Jesus knows he has to die to fulfill his purpose on earth.  And he's not looking forward to it (verse 27).  Even so, "Father, glorify your name."  That's his choice.  To make the sacrifice for us, knowing the pain he has yet to endure.  This is no small moment.</p>
<p><em>Then  a voice came from heaven: "I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again." The crowd that stood there and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said,  "An angel has spoken to him." Jesus answered,  "This voice has come for your sake, not mine." -</em>John 12:28-30 (ESV)</p>
<p>There's a lot to celebrate this week, in which God displayed His humility and love.
