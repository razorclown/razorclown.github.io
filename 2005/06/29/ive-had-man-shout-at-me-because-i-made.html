    <p>I’ve had a man shout at me because I made his lox and bagels closed-face, not open-face.  Same ingredients, mind you, but different presentation.  He literally slammed his plate down on the counter and stormed out of the bagel shop.</p>

<p>I watch people mutter when the have to stand in line for more than a minute.  I’ll be standing behind them, and they’ll turn, shake their heads at me, and make little comments about how long it’s taking.</p>

<p>We have TV shows and magazines devoted to what celebrities wear and what they do on the weekend.  Lots of them.</p>

<p>A couple weekends ago, I was talking to my friend Tony outside of Arden Fair Mall.  You can usually find him down there, hanging around out front.  Working, actually.  He’s homeless, and he spends his days begging for change, so his family can stay in their hotel room for one more night.  We talked about his wife and daughters, his medical problems, and God.  During our conversation, he referred to the mall as “that Babylon over there.”</p>

<p>When we finished talking, I walked to the food court to get lunch, and was more disgusted with the mall at every step.  For the price of one stupid-looking, supposedly cute pair of shoes, Tony and his family could keep their only place to stay for a few more days.  While Tony stood out in the sun, begging for money for food and shelter, someone was complaining about the price of a video game, which they simply did not need.  Pointless, I thought, glaring at the designer clothes and DVDs.</p>

<p>Even as I thought it, I knew I would be playing <i>City of Heroes</i> by the end of the day.</p>

<p>I’ve calmed down a little since that afternoon.  See, I’m something of a capitalist.  I like having cool stuff.  And what I’m thinking is that the problem with our consumer culture isn’t having goodies.  The problem is when we take them seriously.</p>

<p>People actually think they need frivolities.  Whether they take the form of Calvin Klein pajamas, some oversweetened coffee thing at Starbucks, or what have you, the fact is that they’re extras.  Non-essentials.  The problem is, some people seem to be buying into the message the commercials are feeding them: you <i>need</i> our product, and you <i>deserve</i> to have it however you want it.</p>

<p>The problem is, that’s just not true.</p>

<p>While the iPod is a brilliant invention, doesn’t really matter.  You can make it worthwhile – a friend of mine was working on copying the entire Bible into a text file on hers – but that’s not what it’s meant for.  Like so many things, it’s for fun.  And in today’s culture, we’ve begun to prioritize fun above serving others, personal responsibility, and morality.  Obviously problematic.</p>

<p>I don’t believe it’s wrong, in and of itself, to buy cool stuff and enjoy it.  Just don’t pretend you have to.</p>
