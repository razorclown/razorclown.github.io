      <section>
  <h2>The Premise</h2>
  <p>After recalling Overwatch agents to active duty, Winston began researching exceptional individuals throughout the world, creating a list of potential recruits. He prioritized those who had a high likelihood of joining a new incarnation of Overwatch. Near the top of the list are the player characters.</p>
  
  <p>It was not, however, Winston who recruited them.</p>
  
  <p>In the incident that led Winston to trigger the recall, Reaper attacked Watchpoint: Gibraltar and hacked Winston's computer, stealing  a large amount of information about former Overwatch agents.</p>
  
  <p>Unbeknownst to Winston, Reaper’s virus also stole his recruitment files — and, perhaps worse, Athena’s voice synthesis files.</p>
  
  <p>The voice of Athena speaking to the player characters is controlled by Talon.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Who is Cleena?</h2>
  <p>Cleena's real name is Loreena Devitt. She was part of the team that requisitioned supplies for Blackwatch missions. Devitt had no illusions about the nature of Blackwatch’s work — in fact, she appreciated it. Her enthusiasm caught the attention of Gabriel Reyes, and the two became friends.</p>
  
  <p>Shortly before the fall of Overwatch, Reyes warned her that Blackwatch may soon come to light, and even its support staff may face legal and political trouble. He advised her to leave quickly and quietly, and recommended her for a new job.</p>
  
  <p>Devitt took Reyes’ advice and took a position with the Advanced Solutions Institute back in her native Ireland. There, she participated in their Induced Evolution Protocols. She was implanted with brain-stimulating devices designed to activate latent psychic abilities.</p>
  
  <p>The devices worked. Unfortunately for Devitt, they also induced crippling psychosis.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Who is Black Fox?</h2>
  <p>Codename Black Fox has successfully infiltrated five different organizations to gather intelligence for Overwatch by way of the United Nations Special Intelligence Division (UNSID). Alhough technically a junior operative, her talent for disguise and social engineering has proven valuable to her handlers. Her rapid advancement through the intelligence ranks has given her access to highly privileged information, including the identity of both Soldier: 76 and the Reaper.</p>
  <p>Codename Black Fox is a woman named Vittoria Gallo, born in Italy. Her work for UNSID put her in regular contact with Overwatch, giving her insight into its inner workings and personnel.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Introducing the Game</h2>
  
  <p>Ask the players not <em>if</em> they agree to be part of the team, but <em>why</em> they agree.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Finding the Truth</h2>
  <p>The party may discern that they are not working for the real Athena. If they do, Black Fox and Cleena both may know an old Overwatch communication channel (level 4 Knowledge: Overwatch check), which the real Athena will intercept and route them to Winston. They will confirm that Talon has recruited the team.</p>
  
  <p>Winston is unable to come help the team in person. He encourages them to see the mission through, then deliver the firing pin to a safe location.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Objective 1: Retrieve the Scanner</h2>
  
  <p>The party first needs to retrieve a particle detector from the Omnium in Madras, India.</p>
  
  <p>This is technically theft, which may tip off the party that something is off.</p>
  
  <p>The Madras Omnium is still producing inert omnics.</p>
  
  <p>The inert omnics activate in combat mode when the detector is removed.</p>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Madras Omnic</h3>
    <p>Level: 3</p>
    <p>Armor: 1</p>
    <p>Attacks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>4 damage unarmed</li>
      <li>2 damage shock attack (ignores armor)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A group of three or more omnics can attack as one enemy: Level 5, 2 armor, 6 damage, 4 damage shock attack ignores armor</p>
  </section>
  <p>The Omnics can be persuaded to calm down (level 6 persuasion check, level 7 once attacked).</p>
  
  <p>There is also a central control system that can send a command that will cause the Omnics to stand down (level 6 hacking check).</p>
</section>

  
<section>
  <h2>Objective 2: Retrieve the Firing Pin</h2>
  <p>The firing pin of Doomfist's gauntlet is locked away in Watchpoint: Havana.</p>
  
  <p>As Athena briefs the party, she appears not to care about hurting the guards. This may tip off the party that something is amiss.</p>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Havana Guard</h3>
    <p>Level: 3</p>
    <p>Armor: 1</p>
    <p>Attacks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>5 damage assault rifle</li>
      <li>2 damage unarmed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Notice at level 4</p>
  </section>
  <p>An advanced ID scanner can be bypassed by creating a fake ID badge (level 5 forgery check) or stealing one from a guard.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Objective 3: Make the Drop</h2>
  <p>The party is instructed to make the drop in Geneva, Switzerland, in a park that overlooks the ruins of Overwatch headquarters. It is there that Reaper has set his ambush.</p>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Reaper</h3>
    <p>Level: 6</p>
    <p>Armor: 2</p>
    <p>Attacks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hellfire Shotguns: 8 damage at immediate range, 4 damage at short range, 2 damage at long range</li>
      <li>Death Blossom: 6 damage to all in immediate range, 3 damage to all in short range</li>
    </ul>
