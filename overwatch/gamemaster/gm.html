  <h2>The Real Premise</h2>
  <p>After recalling Overwatch agents to active duty, Winston began researching exceptional individuals throughout the world, creating a list of potential recruits. He prioritized those who had a high likelihood of joining a new incarnation of Overwatch. Near the top of the list are the player characters.</p>
  
  <p>But it was not Winston who recruited them.</p>
  
  <p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB5zlHMsM7k">the incident that led Winston to trigger the recall</a>, Reaper attacked Watchpoint: Gibraltar and hacked Winston's computer, stealing a large amount of information about former Overwatch agents.</p>
  
  <p>Unbeknownst to Winston, Reaper’s virus also stole his recruitment files — and, perhaps worse, Athena’s voice synthesis files.</p>
  
  <p>The voice of Athena speaking to the player characters is controlled by Sombra.</p>

  <h2>Secret Character Backgrounds</h2>
  
  <p>Feel free to reveal Cleena's background to her player to help the pacing of the story, or if the player asks. Reveal Black Fox's background to her player before the game begins.</p>

<section>
  <h3>Who is Cleena?</h3>
  <p>Cleena's real name is Loreena Devitt. She was part of the team that requisitioned supplies for Blackwatch missions. Devitt had no illusions about the nature of Blackwatch’s work — in fact, she appreciated it. Her enthusiasm caught the attention of Gabriel Reyes, and the two became friends.</p>
  
  <p>Shortly before the fall of Overwatch, Reyes warned her that Blackwatch may soon come to light, and even its support staff may face legal and political trouble. He advised her to leave quickly and quietly, and recommended her for a new job.</p>
  
  <p>Devitt took Reyes’ advice and took a position with the Advanced Solutions Institute back in her native Ireland. There, she participated in their Induced Evolution Protocols. She was implanted with brain-stimulating devices designed to activate latent psychic abilities.</p>
  
  <p>The devices worked. Unfortunately for Devitt, they also induced crippling psychosis.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Who is Black Fox?</h3>
  <p>Codename Black Fox has successfully infiltrated five different organizations to gather intelligence for Overwatch by way of the United Nations Special Intelligence Division (UNSID). Alhough technically a junior operative, her talent for disguise and social engineering has proven valuable to her handlers. Her rapid advancement through the intelligence ranks has given her access to highly privileged information, including the identities of both Soldier: 76 and the Reaper.</p>
  <p>Codename Black Fox is a woman named Vittoria Gallo, born in Italy. Her work for UNSID put her in regular contact with Overwatch, giving her insight into its inner workings and personnel. She has heard whispers of a high-level conspiracy that may have led to the fall of Overwatch, but she is unsure what to believe.</p>

<h2>Running the Op</h2>
<section>
  <h3>Introducing the Game</h3>
  
  <p>Ask the players not <em>if</em> they agree to be part of the team, but <em>why</em> they agree. Depending on the tone of the game, you could encourage some or all of the characters to have hidden agendas.</p>
  
  <p>Before starting the game in earnest, have each player discuss who is their favorite <em>Overwatch</em> hero. This may give you ideas for the big finish.</p>
  
  <p>Start the game with the party already aboard an old Overwatch transport ship, en route to the first objective. "Athena" is controlling the ship remotely, so the only people on the ship are the party members.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Finding the Truth</h3>
  <p>The party may discern that they are not working for the real Athena. If they do, Black Fox and Cleena both may know an old Overwatch communication channel (level 4 Knowledge: Overwatch check), which the real Athena will intercept and route them to Winston. Athena and Winston confirm that Talon has recruited the team.</p>
  
  <p>Winston is unable to come help the team in person. He encourages them to see the mission through, then deliver the firing pin to a safe location.</p>
  
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Objective 1: Retrieve the Scanner</h3>
  
  <p>The party first needs to retrieve a particle detector from the Omnium in Madras, India.</p>
  
  <p>This is technically theft, which may tip off the party that something is amiss.</p>
  
  <p>The Madras Omnium is still producing inert Omnics. They roll off an assembly line and wander throughout the facility, devoid of consciousness. They have only the most basic programming.</p>
  
  <p>The particle detector is 100 pounds and mounted on a cart. It needs to be attached to the party's ship in order to work. The cart is in a small room near the middle of the facility, and is tagged with a chip that sets off an alarm when removed from the room.</p>
  
  <p>The inert Omnics activate in combat mode when the particle detector is removed. Even in combat mode, have only animal-level intelligence.</p>
  
  <p>Pushing the cart through a crowd of Omnics is a level 5 Might check.</p>
  
  <section>
    <h4>Madras Omnic</h4>
    <p>Level: 3</p>
    <p>Armor: 1</p>
    <p>Attacks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>4 damage unarmed</li>
      <li>2 damage shock attack (ignores armor)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A group of three or more Omnics can attack as one enemy: Level 5, 2 armor, 6 damage, 4 damage shock attack ignores armor</p>
  </section>
  
  <p>There is a central control system that can send a command that will cause the Omnics to stand down (level 6 hacking check).</p>
  
  <p>Grind can also communicate electronically to the other Omnics if somehow connected to them. Another character can use him as an interface and make a level 6 hacking check, or Grind himself can make a level 6 persuasion check, essentially speaking in machine code to soothe the Omnics.</p>
</section>

  
<section>
  <h3>Objective 2: Retrieve the Firing Pin</h3>
  
  <p>Once attached to the ship, the particle detector reveals that the firing pin of Doomfist's gauntlet is locked away in Watchpoint: Havana.</p>
  
  <p>As Athena briefs the party, she appears not to care about hurting the guards. This may tip off the party that something is amiss.</p>
  
  <section>
    <h4>Havana Guard</h4>
    <p>Level: 3</p>
    <p>Armor: 1</p>
    <p>Attacks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>5 damage assault rifle</li>
      <li>2 damage unarmed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Notice at level 4</p>
  </section>
  
  <p>An advanced ID scanner can be bypassed by creating a fake ID badge (level 5 forgery check) or stealing one from a guard.</p>
  
  <p>The firing pin is in a locked room with two guards at the only door. The door's lock can be bypassed (level 4 hacking or lockpicking check) or a keycard can be stolen from one of the two guards.</p>
  
  <p>Removing the firing pin from its case sets off an alarm. The alarm can be disabled (level 5 hacking check). If the alarm is not disabled, groups of three guards attack the party every third round until they escape.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Objective 3: Make the Drop</h3>
  <p>The party is instructed to make the drop in Geneva, Switzerland, in a park that overlooks the ruins of Overwatch headquarters. It is there that Reaper has set his ambush.</p>
  
  <section>
    <h4>Reaper</h4>
    <p>Level: 6</p>
    <p>Armor: 2</p>
    <p>Attacks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hellfire Shotguns: 8 damage at immediate range, 4 damage at short range, 2 damage at long range</li>
      <li>Death Blossom: 6 damage to all in immediate range, 3 damage to all in short range</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  
  <p>If the party attempts to take over the ship and make a run for it, Sombra reveals that she is the fake Athena and crashes the ship. The ship plummets for three rounds before smashing to the ground, causing 10 damage to all still aboard. Reward the players for any clever ideas they come up with to survive the crash. The party wakes up to the sound of Winston's voice warning them that Reaper is on his way to their location.</p>
  
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Aftermath</h3>
    <p>The game could end in any number of ways. Here are some suggestions:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>If the party unites to defeat Reaper, Winston congratulates them and invites them to Watchpoint: Gibraltar to join his new team and meet their new trainer (who you reveal to be the group's favorite <em>Overwatch</em> hero).</li>
      <li>If the party goes rogue and sides with Talon, Reaper welcomes them — as soon as they complete an assassination to prove their loyalty (the target of which is revealed to be the group's favorite <em>Overwatch</em> hero).</li>
    </ul>
