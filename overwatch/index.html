    <h3>Mission Briefing</h3>

    <p>You have been recruited to retrieve it first.</p>

    <h3>The World of Overwatch</h3>
    <p>Overwatch is set in an optimistic near future on the edge of falling into dystopia. It is a world of cybernetics, flying cars, teleporters, and global culture. It is a world recovering from a brutal war between humans and sentient machines.</p>
    <p>The heroes of Overwatch are comparable to the street-level heroes of Marvel, such as Daredevil or Spider-Man. Each of them is engaging enough to star in their own monthly series, but none of them is powerful enough to hold off an army on their own.</p>

    <p class="char-build"><em>An Omnic Explorer who Looks for Trouble</em></p>
    <h4>Biography</h4>
    <p>Real Name: Grind</p>
    <p>Occupation: Activist, Vigilante, Musician</p>
    <p>Base of Operations: Detroit, Michigan, USA</p>
    <p>Affiliation: Southside Scrapps (former)</p>
    <blockquote>&ldquo;You're gonna have to go through me.&rdquo;</blockquote>
    <section class="char-desc">
      <p>After the Omnic Crisis, some communities in America embraced their new robotic neighbors. In other places, Omnic ghettos developed, like the one on the shadow of the Detroit, Michigan omnium. Tensions in the streets ran high between Omnic street gangs and their anti-Omnic rivals.</p>
      <p>The gang wars threatened to destroy entire neighborhoods until one young Omnic took a stand, publicly declaring that a disputed block was under his protection. Incursions from both sides were quickly, dramatically shut down, with no loss of life. Grind quickly gained a reputation for risking his own body to protect his neighbors, human and Omnic alike.</p>
      <p>Grind's first rap EP, <em>D-troid</em>, is beginning to get some attention from hip-hop insiders — and spreading his story.</p>

    <p>Real Name: Arkady Sokolov</p>
    <p>Occupation: Soldier (former), Mechanic, Activist</p>
    <p>Base of Operations: Detroit, Michigan, USA</p>
    <p>Affiliation: Russian Army (former)</p>
    <blockquote>&ldquo;Peace is more difficult than war.&rdquo;</blockquote>
    <section class="char-desc">
      <p>Arkady Sokolov was a field engineer in the Russian Army, specializing in repairing armored units. After losing his leg in combat, he earned an honorable discharge. During his recovery, he wondered if a peaceful future between Omnics and humans were possible.</p>
      <p>Sokolov decided to find out for himself. He emigrated to a city with the highest levels of human-Omnic violence apart from the Russian front: Detroit, Michigan. There, he set up a clinic, repairing injured Omnics.</p>

    <blockquote>&ldquo;Ah, you are thinking what I'm thinking.&rdquo;</blockquote>
    <section class="char-desc">
      <p>The woman known only as Cleena does not match the description of any known missing person. She has been seen throughout Great Britain and Ireland, though never for long in a given place.</p>
      <p>Cleena's interactions with people are few and strange. Those that have spoken with her come away wondering how she managed to answer the questions and voice the thoughts they had not spoken. They find it difficult to forget her wild green eyes and the pulsing of cybernetic implants under her scalp.</p>

    <section class="char-desc">
      <p>Though few people are more at home in the irradiated wastes of the Australian Outback than Emma Turner, the young Junker had big dreams of joining Overwatch and saving the world. She idolized Torbjörn Lindholm in particular, studying any text on engineering and weapons design she could scrounge up, hoping to follow in his footsteps.</p>
      <p>When Overwatch burst back onto the international scene, she ramped up production on her prototype: a modular suit of armor made entirely from scrap which she could summon from great distances.</p>
