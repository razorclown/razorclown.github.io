  <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <h3>Mission Briefing</h3>
    <p>Talon has stolen Doomfist's gauntlet from Numbani. But before they can activate it, they must retrieve a critical component, locked away by Overwatch in a secret location.</p>
    <p>You have been recruited to retrieve it first.</p>

    <h3>The World of Overwatch</h3>
    <p><a href="https://playoverwatch.com"><em>Overwatch</em></a> is set in an optimistic near future world — one on the edge of falling into dystopia. It is a world of cybernetics, flying cars, artificial intelligences, and global culture. It is a world recovering from a brutal war between humans and sentient machines known as Omnics.</p>
    <p>The heroes of <em>Overwatch</em> are comparable to the street-level heroes of Marvel Comics, such as Daredevil or Spider-Man. Any of them is engaging enough to star in their own monthly series, but none of them is powerful enough to hold off an army on their own.</p>

    <h3>The Cypher System</h3>
    <p>The Cypher System by <a href="https://montecookgames.com">Monte Cook Games</a> is an easy-to-learn, d20-based roleplaying game system.</p>
    
    <p>Cypher System characters are built by selecting a descriptor, type, and focus. Sokolov, for example, is a Guarded <em>(descriptor)</em> Warrior <em>(type)</em> who Talks with Machines <em>(focus)</em>. <em>Operation: Athena</em> makes use of its optional rules for superheroes (see <em>Cypher System Rulebook</em>, page 266).</p>

    <h3>Grind</h3>
    <p class="char-build"><em>An Omnic Explorer who Looks for Trouble</em></p>
    <p><a href="characters/grind/">See Grind’s character sheet &rarr;</a></p>
    <h4>Biography</h4>
    <p>Real Name: Grind</p>
    <p>Occupation: Activist, Vigilante, Musician</p>
    <p>Base of Operations: Detroit, Michigan, USA</p>
    <p>Affiliation: Southside Scrapps (former)</p>
    <blockquote>&ldquo;You're gonna have to go through me.&rdquo;</blockquote>
    <section class="char-desc">
      <p>After the Omnic Crisis, some communities in America embraced their new robotic neighbors. In other places, Omnic ghettos developed, like the one on the shadow of the Detroit, Michigan omnium. Tensions in the streets ran high between Omnic street gangs and their anti-Omnic rivals.</p>
      <p>The gang wars threatened to destroy entire neighborhoods until one young Omnic took a stand, publicly declaring that a disputed block was under his protection. Incursions from both sides were quickly — and dramatically — shut down, remarkably with no loss of life. Grind quickly gained a reputation for risking his own body to protect his neighbors, human and Omnic alike.</p>
      <p>Grind's first rap EP, <em>D-troid</em>, is beginning to get some attention from hip-hop insiders — as well as spreading his story of everyday violence in a post-Overwatch world.</p>

    <p class="char-build"><em>A Guarded Warrior who Talks with Machines</em></p>
    <p><a href="characters/sokolov/">See Sokolov’s character sheet &rarr;</a></p>
    <p>Real Name: Arkady Sokolov</p>
    <p>Occupation: Soldier (former), Mechanic, Activist</p>
    <p>Base of Operations: Detroit, Michigan, USA</p>
    <p>Affiliation: Russian Army (former)</p>
    <blockquote>&ldquo;Peace is more difficult than war.&rdquo;</blockquote>
    <section class="char-desc">
      <p>Arkady Sokolov was a field engineer in the Russian Army, specializing in repairing armored units. After losing his leg in combat, he earned an honorable discharge. During his recovery, he wondered if a peaceful future between Omnics and humans were possible.</p>
      <p>Sokolov decided to find out for himself. He emigrated to the city with the highest levels of human-Omnic violence outside the Russian front: Detroit, Michigan. There, he set up a clinic, using his extensive mechanical skills to repair Omnics injured in the clashes between street gangs and human supremacists.</p>
      <p>His efforts have been met with praise and support from the peace-loving Omnic community and threats of violence from those who rely on fear to control the streets. Still, Sokolov continues his work, especially now that his clinic is under Grind's protection.</p>

        <li>Is Sokolov secretly bitter toward Omnics, or does he fully embrace them?</li>

    <p>Affiliation: None</p>
    <blockquote>&ldquo;Ah, you are thinking what I'm thinking.&rdquo;</blockquote>
    <section class="char-desc">
      <p>The woman known only as Cleena does not match the description of any known missing person. She has been sighted throughout Great Britain and Ireland, though never for long in a given place.</p>
      <p>Cleena's interactions with people are few and strange. Those that have spoken with her have reported that she repeatedly answered questions that they were about to ask and responded to thoughts they had not spoken aloud. Several commented on her wild green eyes and the pulsing of cybernetic implants under her scalp.</p>
      <p>Variations of the name &ldquo;Cleena&rdquo; appear in Celtic mythology, associated with a powerful banshee queen. The myths are inconsistent, however, in their portrayal of her character and motives.</p>

        <li>Is Cleena detached from her past or actively seeking to discover it?</li>

    <section class="char-desc">
      <p>Though few people are more at home in the irradiated wastes of the Australian Outback than Emma Turner, the young Junker had big dreams of joining Overwatch and saving the world. She idolized Torbjörn Lindholm in particular, studying any text on engineering and weapons design she could scrounge up, hoping to follow in his footsteps.</p>
      <p>When Overwatch burst back onto the international scene, she ramped up production on her prototype: a modular suit of armor made entirely from scrap which she could summon from great distances. After a few dazzlingly successful outings in the Scrapyard, Picker is ready to make her mark on the world — or so she thinks.</p>
