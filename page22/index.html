<p>It’s a room of adequate size, with a single window looking out on the 
hill behind the church.  Until this afternoon, it was full of stacks 
of chairs.  The carpet is thick and gray, the walls white and covered 
with taped-up Sunday School posters.  The desk in the picture is a 
very recent addition, scavaged hastily from another room.&lt;p&gt;When Michael showed me this little room, I got pretty excited. Why?&lt;p&gt;Because this is my office. And this, my friends, is a “before” picture.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/22/counterproductivity.html">Counterproductivity</a></h3>
  <p><p>I'm not sure who ever thought procrastination was a good idea.  Certainly hasn't done me any good yet.</p>
<p>The reason I put off things I have to do is because I don't want to put in the effort to get them done at the moment.  I'd rather rest and be comfortable now, and work later.  But that's not how it works.  When I'm putting something off, I know I'm putting it off.  What supposed rest I gain from procrastination isn't that restful, because worrying about getting something done takes a lot of energy - maybe more than just getting done the task at hand.</p>
<p>This is yesterday's blog post, by the way.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/21/chill.html">Chill.</a></h3>
  <p><p>Fridays are my days of least discipline, sometimes intentionally, sometimes not.</p>
<p>I'd like to say I'm taking a Sabbath rest on Friday evenings, but like I said, it's not a normal, intentional thing I do.  It may be in the future, but now, it depends very much on what's on my calendar.</p>
<p>The Jews were commanded in strict terms to do no work on the seventh day, but instead to rest and reflect on God.  Saturday was the seventh day day of their week, so one could infer that the weekend is ordained by God.  Heh.</p>
<p>Michael discussed the Sabbath with the college group once, and made a very interesting point.  Our lives are increasingly busy, our calendars inordinately full.  The Sabbath rest is an opportunity to just let go for a few hours, and acknowledge that God really is in control.  To demonstrate that life doesn't fall apart when we take our hands off. </p>
<p>I think I should re-examine how I lay out my weekends.  I'd really like to not just take time to rest and have fun, but really display that principle of trust in my life.  Part of the issue is time management, part of it faith.  That's a blend that confounds me, sometimes.</p>

  <p><p>"This is impossible," Phelps mumbled inaudibly, pressing himself against the wall opposite the window.</p>
<p>The woman floating outside the window nodded, her arms crossed over her chest.  "It is."  Her voice was in no way muffled by the thick transparent barrier between them.</p>
<p>"How are you-"</p>
<p>"When you arrive in New Sidon, go directly to St. Luke's Temple.  There you will meet Deacon Mariah.  She will give you your instructions."</p>
<p>Phelps gawked at her, mind racing.</p>
<p>Then, she smiled.  "Farewell, prophet."</p>
<p>"Wait!  Wh-"</p>
<p>"All passengers, please secure yourselves for landing.  We will reach the outer atmosphere shortly.  Arrival in New Tyre will be 7:00 am, local time."</p>
<p>Phelps looked up involuntarily at the intercom announcement, then looked back to the window to see nothing but stars.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/18/when-as-yet-there-were-none.html">When As Yet There Were None</a></h3>
  <p><p> For you  formed my inward parts;
 you  knitted me together in my mother’s womb.
 I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. 
 Wonderful are your works;
 my soul knows it very well.
 My frame was not hidden from you,
 when I was being made in secret,
 intricately woven in  the depths of the earth.
 Your eyes saw my unformed substance;
 in your  book were written, every one of them,
 the days that were formed for me,
 when as yet there were none of them.</p>
<p>Psalms 139:13-16 (ESV)
</p>
<p>If you drew hard theology from this passage, you might make some conclusions about predestination and free will.  But this is a poem.  A song.  That's what a Psalm is.  It's not the best place to determine the specific workings of the spiritual.  It is, however, the perfect place to learn to worship.
</p>
<p>Sometimes God makes right turns.  We think we know exactly where He's headed, and the path He'll take us along to get there.  One thing you learn quickly when you try to follow God is that He loves off-roading.</p>
<p>Even though He's God, it's really easy to get annoyed at Him.  To doubt Him.  We get awfully attached to our own visions of our own lives, and when He - politely or not - informs us that He has a different vision, we tend to get up in arms.</p>
<p>In Psalm 139, David recognizes what we so readily forget.  A simple fact that changes everything when we actually believe it.</p>
<p>God loves us, and He knows what He's doing.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/17/commence-wailing.html">Commence Wailing</a></h3>
  <p><p>I've been listening to a lot of emo lately.  Not the acoustic guitar and whiny vocals variety, no.  More the big rock guitars, good beats, and whiny vocals variety.  I'm kinda surprised at myself.</p>
<p>See, when I first heard Fall Out Boy's "Sugar, We're Going Down," I realized that there was a new movement in music that I hated.  I hated it before it was a genre.  You could hear it coming in "Warning" by Incubus, for example.  The wailing vocal parts, sometimes atypical rhythms, lack of rhyme, things like that.  Eventually there were more and more songs with these long run-on sentences for titles, and all these clever lyrics.  When you're trying to be clever, it's really hard not to be annoying.</p>
<p>The first crack in my annoyance came when I saw the video for Fall Out Boy's "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race."  Again, long song name and lyrics that were clever to the point of being pushy... but the beat!  The song gets a good sort of Michael Jackson vibe going, then breaks into a fast pop-punk chorus, and it all works together.</p>
<p>Then, I played <em>Prey</em>.  Very well done, very innovative video game.  Beat the final boss, watched the denouement, and the credits begin to roll.  Over the credits plays "Take Me Home" by After Midnight Project, and I realize with a shock that it's definitely an emo song, and I definitely don't hate it.  The beat is steady and insistent, the guitar work skillful, the vocals emotive.  Then the chorus hits, and everything soars.</p>
<p>The thing about emo is that there's a much greater variety within the genre than I originally thought.  Songs like "Coffee's for Closers" by Fall Out Boy and "Welcome to the Black Parade" by My Chemical Romance are impressive for the sheer number of disparate elements coming together to make a good song.  Sometimes the depressing / bitter lyrics are coming at you in a major key.  Sometimes there are techno elements, sometimes horns.</p>
<p>I've found a lot of stuff I like through <a href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora</a>.  If you're curious, you can find other songs I like on <a href="http://www.pandora.com/?sc=sh69262296273647487">this station.</a></p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/16/pathos.html">Pathos</a></h3>
  <p><p>A titan, curled in on himself.</p>
<p>A giant, eyes clenched tight.</p>
<p>In the corner of his dripping eye, the stars.</p>
<p>Were he to stand, could he reach them?</p>
<p>Could he have them?</p>
<p>Knees drawn, face to earth, he whimpers.</p>
<p>"A thousand million choices,</p>
<p>all wrong."</p>
<p>And so the lights remain distant as dreams,</p>
<p>the earth no brighter.</p>
<p>(not a very good poem, I don't think, but an illustration nonetheless of somewhere i've been off and on for a while.  feeling much better now, having talked to and prayed with my pastor.  i recommend it.)</p>

<p>I think there may be a bit if a backhanded upside to our current economic situation.&lt;p&gt;The whole mortgage crisis and the credit crunch are awfully complex. People talk of good debt turned bad, of banks that aren’t intetested in foreclosing on homes, of spending billions of taxpayer dollars to help failing businesses. Who knew who Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were before all this started? And who among them knew they were government agencies?&lt;p&gt;A lot of the problems apparently came from very sophisticated financial commodities. Some problems were more simple: people weren’t able to pay their debt. A story on National Public Radio noted that the current total indebtedness of the American people is now at the level of the Gross National Product. The only other recorded time that happened? Just before the Great Depression.&lt;p&gt;My hope is that this crisis will get our attention. We’ve gotten awfully comfortable with debt as a culture, with myself as an example. I, for one, intend to maintain relative financial simplicity. To start living more strictly within my means, even if that means - gasp - lowering my standard of living a little.&lt;p&gt;Some of you think that’s a really obvious choice. I think it’s an oddly foreign concept to my generation. Maybe this is our chance to get our priorities straight.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/14/keyed-up.html">Keyed Up</a></h3>
  <p><p>Ack!  Missed a post.  I’ll double up today.  Storytime.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I found myself getting very nervous, quite stressed out.  There was something on my mind that would have made me anxious anyway, but in the process of trying to calm myself down, I realized something.
</p>
<p>Thus far that day, I'd consumed a large cup of coffee and two sugary pastries.  I'd been listening to punk rock - highly aggressive, noisy, intense music - for around four hours straight.  And I was sitting in front of my computer the whole time, typing, with my shoulders bunched up from my elbows resting on the chair's arms, craning my neck at the papers on my desk, then staring at my glaring backlit monitor.</p>
<p>Whether or not my issue <em>du jour</em> was worth worrying about, my environment was of no help.</p>
<p>So I had lunch with a friend, outside in the sunshine.  Very helpful.  Funny enough, during the course of the conversation, I chuckled, gave her a reassuring little scratch on the back, and told her, "my dear, you gotta learn to relax."</p>

  <p><p>My entry tonight is just my notes from tonight’s Bible study. Ashley’s 
lesson could have been written specifically for me.&lt;p&gt;2 Thess 3:6-13
-do not grow weary of doing good.&lt;p&gt;Idleness. Aimlessness. (sloth.)
-is not Christlike.
-is appealing, and influential to others.
   -1 thess 5:14 - admonish the idle
-doesn’t mix with initiative.
   -God isn’t into gray areas.
-is unfruitful by nature.
-drains away integrity.
-is not defeated merely by intent, but by action.
-is hypocritical.
   -Take up your cross and follow me.
-drains resources and contributes nothing.
-hinders God’s work.
-neuters our calling.&lt;p&gt;Am I occupied with God’s purpose?
What do I have to show for my work?
What’s coming out of my mouth? (aha.)
   -Defensive? Judgmental? Gossip?&lt;p&gt;“There’s no unemployment for spirituality.” -Shane&lt;p&gt;Gal. 6:9 - at the proper time, we will reap a harvest if we do not 
give up.</p>
