    <p>Once again, John has made a comment in my guestbook that warrants a public response.  It follows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> I seem to remember hearing you once saying you were looking for someone 'who would be a good wife' rather then someone you love…. (frankly if such a thing is true, I'm deeply disturbed by such sentiment) 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>waves hand</em></p>

<p>But thats not the point of this post. I guess the only thing I can say for you is that you have only yourself to blame (regarding Liesel). The two of you were obviously very much interested in each other, and I think that it’s sad that you decided to punish not only yourself but the one you loved (?) simply on the matter of spirituality. I know you will say that that is THE cornerstone of your very existance and you would not be here if it weren’t for God, BUT <em>sighs loudly and shakes head</em>…</p>

<p>Regardless, on to the next thing I wanted to share. Your recent… clingyness (for severe lack of a better word) has been bothering me lately. I guess part of it is that I’ve never been big on unsolicited physical intimacy (in most cases). I enjoy it, very much so, but somehow I find it rather rude when a person hangs off one who has given no signals that they want such behavior or wish it to continue. I’m sure this is just me, and not you, but I felt compelled to share. Besides, my discussion with Neko made much sense. You are, after all, only human and can only resist being a boy for so long.</p>

<p>I knew there was more I wanted to say, and I’m not sure I said everything as well as I wanted to, but posting it gets it out there. I really would like to spend some more time with you in the future, as we rarely get to hang out/talk and usually your to busy looking after us when I do see you ;-P</p>

<p>But I think it’s important to say that you are indeed one of the finest human beings I know, and that I have never known you to not have your heart in the right place. Peace and love, brother.</p>

<p>My response, paragraph by paragraph:</p>

<p>I failed to make something clear during my earlier discussion on romance.  Someone with that kind of compatibility, with all the things that would make a lasting relationship possible… I mean, how could you not fall in love with someone like that?  The basis of the relationship should not be strong feelings, but compatibility.  Feelings, though, are going to be present.</p>

<p>But nothing.  Jesus is the cornerstone of my life, and should be when He’s not.  I belive that by not going out with Liesel, I’ve saved us both pain.  Certainly, this path hurts, too.  But I belive it’s honestly better for both of us.  Liesel and I are still friends,and I love the relationship we have.  I’ve gone out of my way not to hurt her and myself.  There is nothing of punishment in my actions, but love.</p>

<p>I am aware of my clinginess.  It’s one of the most prominent issues in my life.  And I’m making continual efforts to combat it.  I have apologized to Carolyn on several occasions.  But by no means am I trying to resist being a boy.  I’m trying to do it correctly.</p>

<p>I will have more time soon, I think, to spend with people.  You’re most definitely on my list.</p>

<p>I often have to drag my heart into the right place.  I’m just glad I know which general direction to drag it in.  Thanks.</p>
