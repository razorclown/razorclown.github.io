    <p>I read this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><sup>11</sup> So both of them showed themselves to the Philistine outpost. “Look!” said the Philistines. “The Hebrews are crawling out of the holes they were hiding in.” <sup>12</sup>The men of the outpost shouted to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, “Come up to us and we’ll teach you a lesson.”</p>

<p>So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, “Climb up after me; the LORD has given them into the hand of Israel.”</p>

<p><sup>13</sup> Jonathan climbed up, using his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer right behind him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer followed and killed behind him. <sup>14</sup> In that first attack Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed some twenty men in an area of about half an acre.</p>

<p><cite>&mdash;1 Samuel 14:11-14</cite></p>

</blockquote>

<p>And I see this:</p>

<style>
    .screenplay {
        font-family: monospace;
        font-size: .875em;

<p class="sp-scene">SCENE: EXTERIOR. CLIFFSIDE AT MIKMASH</p>

<p>JONATHAN and his ARMOR BEARER step from behind the boulder, squaring off with the cluster of PHILISTINE GUARDS at the top of the hill. One of the GUARDS spots them. He lazily draws his sword, and the others do the same.</p>

<div class="sp-dialog">
    <p class="sp-char">GUARD 1</p>
    

<p>Well, well. Looks like the Hebrews are crawling out of their holes.</p>
</div>

<p>The GUARDS laugh. JONATHAN stares them down, sword in hand. His ARMOR BEARER, unarmed, glances at his master, waiting for orders.</p>

<div class="sp-dialog">
    <p class="sp-char">GUARD 2</p>
    

<p>You wanna learn how to fight? Huh? Come up here and I'll show you!</p>
</div>

<p>A fierce, predatory smile works its way across JONATHAN's face.</p>

<div class="sp-dialog">
    <p class="sp-char">JONATHAN</p>
    

<p>That's the sign. They're ours.</p>
</div>

<p>JONATHAN dashes up the steep hill, scrambling up the slope, flinging dirt and stones behind him in his haste. The ARMOR BEARER, breathing heavily, is close behind.</p>

<p>GUARD 2 waits for his enemy, idly stretching his swordarm. The GUARDS laugh at the HEBREWS running uphill to their deaths. As JONATHAN approaches striking distance, GUARD 2 rears back for a killing stroke. He swings.</p>

<p>SFX: "Existence" by August Burns Red</p>

<p>JONATHAN, cresting the cliff in a three-point stance, lunges forward, parrying the blow with such force that GUARD 2's sword flies out of his grasp. GUARD 2 barely has time to look stunned before JONATHAN cuts him down with a backhand stroke of his sword.</p>

<p>GUARD 1, enraged, charges at JONATHAN, sword raised high for an overhand chop. JONATHAN steps into the attack, grabbing the PHILISTINE's wrist and wrenches it down, trapping GUARD 1's arm his under his own. He swings GUARD 1 toward the cliff edge and kicks him in the chest. With the flourish of a stage magician, JONATHAN  snatches GUARD 1's sword from his hand as the PHILISTINE tumbles down the cliff.</p>

<p>JONATHAN'S ARMOR BEARER reaches the top of the cliff and finally stands up straight. JONATHAN -- still grinning with bloodthirsty zeal -- turns back to the rest of the GUARDS and begins marching toward them, tossing the sword high to his left. His ARMOR BEARER matches his pace, catching the sword with one hand.</p>

<p>The PHILISTINES charge.</p>

<p>Roaring for blood, JONATHAN surges into their midst. He whirls and cuts, moving more like a dancer than a fighter. He bats their attacks aside without looking at them. As soon as one of them drops, his ARMOR BEARER leaps forward to finish them off. The PHILISTINE GUARDS outnumber them ten to one, but they don't stand a chance.</p>

<p>The Bible is fun to read when you get into it.</p>

<p>Do you see other scenes from the Bible cinematically? Who would you cast for this scene?</p>
