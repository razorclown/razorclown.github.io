    <p>Pontius Pilate was a good politician, but a bad philosopher. At least, that’s what I get from <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2018:29-38&amp;version=NIV">his interaction with Jesus</a>.</p>

<p>A crowd of Jews, including some of their religious authorities, shoved a bruised man at him - also a Jew - and demanded the man’s death. He knew something was up when he asked what Jesus had done, and they said, “If he weren’t a criminal, we wouldn’t have brought him to you.”</p>

<p>Given the animosity between the Jews and the Romans? Probably not true in the first place.</p>

<p>Confounded, Pilate questioned Jesus. He couldn’t figure out what the problem was. Jesus hadn’t done anything, but the religious leaders wanted Him dead. The truth was, killing Him would be wrong.</p>

<p>But Pilate was the governor of the region. It was his responsibility to maintain order amidst a people with a history of rebellion. And Jesus was causing a ruckus.</p>

<p>He was torn between what was safe and what was true.</p>

<p>But there was an even deeper truth he didn’t know. He was at a turning point in history. The Author of truth stood before him, on trial. The Source of reality was looking him in the eye. Jesus even gave him a hint. “Everyone on the side of truth,” He said, “listens to me.”</p>

<p>“What is truth?” Pilate asked… and went back outside.</p>

<p>If only he hadn’t asked rhetorically. If only he had stuck around for the answer. He said the right words, but that was all. He was nearer the truth than he’d ever been, and perhaps he would never know it.</p>

<p>We do this all the time.</p>

<p>We argue for the sake of argument. We dodge uncomfortable ideas we can’t refute. We ask high-minded questions without ever waiting for the answer.</p>

<p>All that’s fine. Unless you really are looking for the truth.</p>

<p>If you want to find truth, you have to give up being right all the time. It takes humility. It requires actual listening and consideration. It means letting go of assumptions and opinions as necessary.</p>

<p>It means not taking the easy way out.</p>
