    <p>I hate being wrong. Even so, I know I sometimes need people to call me out when I am.</p>

<p>On Wednesday of last week, I taught the Bible study. We talked about one of the hardest but most necessary means of spiritual growth: accountability.</p>

<p>Do you have someone that will tell you when you’re messing up? Someone you’ll actually listen to?</p>

<p>Accountability (<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/70067/Accountability.mp3">.mp3</a>)</p>

<p>I had a feeling that the conversation would cover a range of toics, so I tried organizing my notes a little differently than I usually do. They are below.</p>

<p>~</p>

<p>//recap</p>

<p>So, we’re gonna continue through this period of Israel’s history when the kingdom is split in two. We have the Kingdom of Israel in the north and Judah in the south. You heard about Elijah a couple weeks ago. Elijah was a prophet to the Northern Kingdom Israel and had some trouble with King Ahab and his wife, who are doing a very poor job of following God and leading the nation.  In fact, in this period of Israel’s history there were lots of ups and downs as far as following God, from King to king, or even for individual Kings.</p>

<p>//preview</p>

<p>During this period, God sent prophets to the kings of Israel and Judah to try to keep them and the people on track. Or, at the very least, accountable for the bad choices they were making.</p>

<p>Have you ever had a friend call you out on something you were doing wrong?</p>

<p>Did it ever save you a lot of trouble? Still, was it hard?<!--more--></p>

<p>Have you ever been the one to confront a friend when they were going down the wrong path? For some of us, that’s even harder than being corrected.</p>

<p>One of the main things I want us to walk away with tonight is this: accountability is a really hard thing to do right, but it’s one of the most necessary things for our growth in Christ. If we do it wrong, it can really damage our relationships, or obscure people’s view of God. If we do it right, however, we can help people connect more deeply with God. We can teach each other God’s ways, and help each other avoid or escape bad situations.</p>

<p>//verse</p>

<p>22 You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; 23 to be made new in the attitude of your minds; 24 and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. 25 Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all members of one body.</p>

<p>-Ephesians 4:22-25</p>

<p>Earlier in that same chapter, in verse 15, Paul refers to “speaking the truth in love” and growing toward unity and maturity. That’s what accountability is all about.</p>

<p>//subpoint: applies to believers</p>

<p>Please note that in the verses in Ephesians, and the ones following, we’re talking about believers interacting with believers. It doesn’t necessarily work the same way with unbelievers. What we’re talking about tonight applies directly to people that have decided to follow God, and perhaps others that that you really trust, and that trust you. It’s different if someone hasn’t committed to God, especially if you don’t have a close relationship with them. If you haven’t developed trust, tread lightly.</p>

<p>//main lesson</p>

<p>Tonight we’re going to read about a time when the priests of Judah had to hold one of their kings accountable.  That King was Uzziah, also known as Azariah.</p>

<p>Let’s read the story in 2 Chronicles 26.</p>

<p>//verse</p>

<p>16 But after Uzziah became powerful, his pride led to his downfall. He was unfaithful to the LORD his God, and entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense. 17 Azariah the priest with eighty other courageous priests of the LORD followed him in. 18 They confronted King Uzziah and said, “It is not right for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD. That is for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who have been consecrated to burn incense. Leave the sanctuary, for you have been unfaithful; and you will not be honored by the LORD God.”</p>

<p>19 Uzziah, who had a censer in his hand ready to burn incense, became angry. While he was raging at the priests in their presence before the incense altar in the LORD’s temple, leprosy[c] broke out on his forehead. 20 When Azariah the chief priest and all the other priests looked at him, they saw that he had leprosy on his forehead, so they hurried him out. Indeed, he himself was eager to leave, because the LORD had afflicted him.</p>

<p>-2 Chronicles 26:16-20</p>

<p>Okay. What did Uzziah do wrong?</p>

<p>He took the role of priest.</p>

<p>That wasn’t his job. The priests say so. Who’s supposed to enter the holy place and burn the incense? “The descendants of Aaron.” Who else? No one.</p>

<p>//verse</p>

<p>39 So Eleazar the priest collected the bronze censers brought by those who had been burned to death, and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar, 40 as the LORD directed him through Moses. This was to remind the Israelites that no one except a descendant of Aaron should come to burn incense before the LORD, or he would become like Korah and his followers.</p>

<p>-Numbers 16:40</p>

<p>Who are Korah and his followers?</p>

<p>The story goes, some guys tried to rebel against Moses. They questioned his leadership – and, by extension, God’s choice of leadership. So, God arranged a little test. Aaron and Moses, God’s chosen priests, stood on one side, offering incense. Korah and his followers stood on the other side, offering incense. Only one side came out alive. God literally opened the ground under the leaders of the rebellion and closed it over them. And Korah’s followers that were offering incense, God purged with fire.</p>

<p>So, if you’re a descendant of Aaron, you’re safe, right? Not necessarily.</p>

<p>//verse</p>

<p>1 Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu took their censers, put fire in them and added incense; and they offered unauthorized fire before the LORD, contrary to his command. 2 So fire came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed them, and they died before the LORD.</p>

<p>-Leviticus 10:1-2</p>

<p>Okay. God obviously takes this incense thing very seriously. He wants it done in just the way he prescribed.</p>

<p>//subpoint: pride</p>

<p>“But after Uzziah became powerful, his pride led to his downfall.”</p>

<p>There’s a lesson and a half right there. The Scriptures tell us over and over that God loves humility and opposes pride. That’s because pride is simply this: following your authority over God’s.</p>

<p>Uzziah decided to make himself a priest, and put himself in a position he wasn’t meant to be in. When we act out of pride, that’s what happens: we end up where we were never meant to be.</p>

<p>One of the most dangerous part? Uzziah wasn’t going to listen to them. He didn’t listen to good correction. The priests were right to come to him. They were right to say what they did. But the king didn’t listen. He flipped out. If God hadn’t afflicted him right then and there, who knows what would have happened.</p>

<p>Has your pride gotten you into some tough situations? Could humility have saved you some pain? Could putting aside your pride and listening to someone’s warning have gotten you out of trouble?</p>

<p>//subpoint: when to speak up</p>

<p>This story helps us answer one of the hardest questions about accountability: at what point do you say something?</p>

<p>Consider this: Uzziah was putting himself in danger. This story reminds me of one of my favorite proverbs.</p>

<p>//verse</p>

<p>There is a way that appears to be right; but in the end it leads to death.</p>

<p>-Proverbs 14:12 / 16:25</p>

<p>Not only that, he could have harmed the whole nation. It would have been a terrible example. He could have deprived Israel of his leadership, which had been great up until that point.</p>

<p>That’s one good criterion: when someone is clearly harming themselves and others. I think we’ve all done things that seemed like good ideas at the time, but really weren’t.</p>

<p>//segue to priests</p>

<p>Let’s see what we can learn from the priests. They did a lot of things right that we can learn from.</p>

<p>//subpoint: courage</p>

<p>The Bible says they had courage. Why would they need courage? For that matter, why would we?</p>

<p>This is a tough situation for them. The Bible says that Uzziah was a powerful king, and had been very successful up until this point. He had won wars, built a powerful army, fortified Jeruaslem, and had been a godly man besides. With all that, he was probably popular, too. Besides all that, he was their king. It took some guts to stand up to him.</p>

<p>For some of us, it’s really hard to confront people. We don’t want them to be mad at us. We don’t want to hurt them. We don’t want to tell someone their business or come off as judgmental. We aren’t sure they’re even wrong.</p>

<p>We should consider all those things. But we can’t let them keep us from confronting someone when we’re called to it. When we have a duty to do so.</p>

<p>For others, it’s way too easy to confront people. We don’t care what they think or feel. We know we’re right. Maybe we’re itchin’ to put them in their place. For those of us who are like that, we need to approach the situation with as much humility as they had courage.</p>

<p>//subpoint: know your stuff</p>

<p>They were clearly in the right. What the brought to the king wasn’t a matter of opinion. It was clearly laid out in God’s law.</p>

<p>If you’re gonna tell someone “that’s wrong,” make sure it is. It’s way too easy to be forceful with our own ideas of how someone should run their life. The priests went straight to God’s Word; so should we.</p>

<p>//subpoint: they went to him</p>

<p>They confronted him directly. I mention this because it’s way easier to criticize someone from afar instead of talking to them personally. It’s really uncomfortable. And if you just gossip about someone instead, you also get that feeling of superiority. You can be all indignant about it. The priests, on the other hand, took the issue to the person who had the issue.</p>

<p>Are you prone to gossip? Have you talked behind someone’s back rather than talking to them directly?</p>
