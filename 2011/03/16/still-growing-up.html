    <p>I just got to hang out with a good friend of mine. We’d seen each other at church a bunch, but we hadn’t had a good, long conversation in a while. It seems like I was in his wedding, then a few years passed, and here we are.</p>

<p>That, I’ve found, is the biggest difference between adolescence and adulthood: the amount of time you get to spend with your friends.</p>

<p>That surprised me when I realized it. For most of my youth, I thought of adults as being very adult for the most part: wise, experienced, responsible, capable, confident, and well-resourced. I thought that by the time you got to be a grown-up, you’d basically have your act together.</p>

<p>I’m 27. I’m a husband, father, and pastor, and I don’t have my act all together.</p>

<p>I got out into the working world when I was 17 or so. As I spent more time around adults, I realized a truly horrifying thing.</p>

<p>High school really does prepare you for the rest of life. Some people never move past that level of maturity. Funny enough, my co-workers at church are some of the youngest, but most mature people I’ve worked with.</p>

<p>I was shocked to discover that experience does not always equate to wisdom. I was dumbfounded when I ran into well-educated-yet-immature people. I was frankly dismayed when I realized that, quite often, “experts” are people that know just enough to be dangerous.</p>

<p>I kept expecting that, someday, I would feel like I knew what I was doing. Then, I looked around and saw other people having the same thought.</p>

<p>To be fair, I have grown a lot since high school. A lot. I continue to mature, quicker in some areas than in others. Still, adulthood doesn’t feel like I thought it would. I thought I’d be done growing, and be all sophisticated.</p>

<p>On one hand, this bodes well for us geeks. I recently read (most of) an article in Salon about <a href="http://www.salon.com/life/feature/2011/03/08/dungeons_and_dragons_comes_back/index.html">grown-ups playing D&amp;D</a>. I thought I’d automatically grow out of gaming at a certain age, like shedding a cocoon. Not necessarily.</p>

<p>This could work.</p>

<p>The only problem - as I mentioned at the beginning of the post - is finding the time. I have to be really deliberate about scheduling my life compared to even a couple years ago. I’m still not very good at it, but I’m better than I’ve ever been. There’s that growth I was talking about.</p>

<p>Being an adult is more a matter of steadily maturing than finally being mature. It’s a matter of shifting my priorities from myself to others.</p>

<p>But I still get to play video games occasionally, so… woot.</p>
