  <h3><a href="/2011/03/19/the-playlist.html">The Playlist</a></h3>
  <p><p>“Merit for Sadness” by Haste the Day popped into my head the other day, and I put together a playlist around it. I realized that the end of the song would transition seamlessly into “Existence” by August Burns Red. After that metal onslaught, I thought a slower-paced song would do, so I threw in a low-tempo Demon Hunter song. I had “Artist in the Ambulance” stuck in my head soon after, and added “Injection” as a bridge.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/17/commence-wailing.html">Commence Wailing</a></h3>
  <p><p>I've been listening to a lot of emo lately.  Not the acoustic guitar and whiny vocals variety, no.  More the big rock guitars, good beats, and whiny vocals variety.  I'm kinda surprised at myself.</p>
<p>See, when I first heard Fall Out Boy's "Sugar, We're Going Down," I realized that there was a new movement in music that I hated.  I hated it before it was a genre.  You could hear it coming in "Warning" by Incubus, for example.  The wailing vocal parts, sometimes atypical rhythms, lack of rhyme, things like that.  Eventually there were more and more songs with these long run-on sentences for titles, and all these clever lyrics.  When you're trying to be clever, it's really hard not to be annoying.</p>
<p>The first crack in my annoyance came when I saw the video for Fall Out Boy's "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race."  Again, long song name and lyrics that were clever to the point of being pushy... but the beat!  The song gets a good sort of Michael Jackson vibe going, then breaks into a fast pop-punk chorus, and it all works together.</p>
<p>Then, I played <em>Prey</em>.  Very well done, very innovative video game.  Beat the final boss, watched the denouement, and the credits begin to roll.  Over the credits plays "Take Me Home" by After Midnight Project, and I realize with a shock that it's definitely an emo song, and I definitely don't hate it.  The beat is steady and insistent, the guitar work skillful, the vocals emotive.  Then the chorus hits, and everything soars.</p>
<p>The thing about emo is that there's a much greater variety within the genre than I originally thought.  Songs like "Coffee's for Closers" by Fall Out Boy and "Welcome to the Black Parade" by My Chemical Romance are impressive for the sheer number of disparate elements coming together to make a good song.  Sometimes the depressing / bitter lyrics are coming at you in a major key.  Sometimes there are techno elements, sometimes horns.</p>
<p>I've found a lot of stuff I like through <a href="http://www.pandora.com">Pandora</a>.  If you're curious, you can find other songs I like on <a href="http://www.pandora.com/?sc=sh69262296273647487">this station.</a></p>

  <h3><a href="/2007/10/24/album-review-nightwishs-dark-passion.html">Album Review: Nightwish's Dark Passion Play</a></h3>
  <p><p>Nightwish has changed since <em>Once</em>.  But it’s not as shocking a transition as you might think.  The sudden departure of Tarja Turunen in 2005 was nothing short of traumatic for the fans – as well as the band, from the sound of the first two tracks of <span style="font-style:italic;">Dark Passion Play</span>.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2006/04/11/i-really-enjoy-putting-together.html">I Really Enjoy Putting Together</a></h3>
  <p><p>I really enjoy putting together playlists.  Something about establishing a mood with music, then elaborating on it.  There’s an element of storytelling there for me - I get a lot of story ideas while listening to music, and I always visualize action to go with a song.</p>

  <p><p>Killswitch Engage is an absolutely amazing band.  Inspirational lyrics presented in hardcore style - screamed over hammering guitars.  A thing of beauty to be sure.  I’ve just picked up their <i>The End of Heartache</i>.  Just what I needed.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2004/01/14/not-long-ago-i-formed-list-of-songs.html">Not Long Ago I Formed List Of Songs</a></h3>
  <p><p>Not long ago, I formed a list of songs that were dear to me.  The list had long been there in my mind: songs that had - somewhere between the music, the lyrics, and the mood they invoked - inspired me.  Some were irrevocably tied to memories.  Some had evoked images, or even characters for stories.  All of them had a certain underlying drama that gave them life.</p>
