<p>In front of the courthouse in downtown Sacramento is a sculpture. A 
fountain.  The chaotic, curving shapes remind me of nothing so much as a series of distorted antlers, flowing from one to another.  There is a single break in the jagged ring, one small gap where the pieces don’t quite come together.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/04/01/not-so-hopeless.html">Not So Hopeless</a></h3>
  <p><p>A little over five years ago, this is <a href="http://razorclown.blogspot.com/2004/02/i-should-clarify-my-previous-two-posts.html">what I was thinking</a>:</p>
<p>"I used to be a hopeless romantic. Turns out that part of that deal is being hopeless. "</p>
<p>I spent years stomping on my romantic side, and it's messed with my perspective.  What seemed to me like wisdom at the time was obviously just an expression of lonely bitterness.  I reacted, not to the perfectly normal desire to find a soulmate, but to the painful desperation I felt at the time to find someone.  For too long, they were the same thing to me.</p>
<p>It's taken me years of personal growth and prayer, but I'm finally able to separate the two.  To be honest, romantic affection apart from intense heartache is still kind of a new idea for me.  I'm still making a few mental adjustments.</p>
<p>But, thank God, I'm learning what it's supposed to be like.</p>

<p>It’s a room of adequate size, with a single window looking out on the 
hill behind the church.  Until this afternoon, it was full of stacks 
of chairs.  The carpet is thick and gray, the walls white and covered 
with taped-up Sunday School posters.  The desk in the picture is a 
very recent addition, scavaged hastily from another room.&lt;p&gt;When Michael showed me this little room, I got pretty excited. Why?&lt;p&gt;Because this is my office. And this, my friends, is a “before” picture.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/22/counterproductivity.html">Counterproductivity</a></h3>
  <p><p>I'm not sure who ever thought procrastination was a good idea.  Certainly hasn't done me any good yet.</p>
<p>The reason I put off things I have to do is because I don't want to put in the effort to get them done at the moment.  I'd rather rest and be comfortable now, and work later.  But that's not how it works.  When I'm putting something off, I know I'm putting it off.  What supposed rest I gain from procrastination isn't that restful, because worrying about getting something done takes a lot of energy - maybe more than just getting done the task at hand.</p>
<p>This is yesterday's blog post, by the way.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/21/chill.html">Chill.</a></h3>
  <p><p>Fridays are my days of least discipline, sometimes intentionally, sometimes not.</p>
<p>I'd like to say I'm taking a Sabbath rest on Friday evenings, but like I said, it's not a normal, intentional thing I do.  It may be in the future, but now, it depends very much on what's on my calendar.</p>
<p>The Jews were commanded in strict terms to do no work on the seventh day, but instead to rest and reflect on God.  Saturday was the seventh day day of their week, so one could infer that the weekend is ordained by God.  Heh.</p>
<p>Michael discussed the Sabbath with the college group once, and made a very interesting point.  Our lives are increasingly busy, our calendars inordinately full.  The Sabbath rest is an opportunity to just let go for a few hours, and acknowledge that God really is in control.  To demonstrate that life doesn't fall apart when we take our hands off. </p>
<p>I think I should re-examine how I lay out my weekends.  I'd really like to not just take time to rest and have fun, but really display that principle of trust in my life.  Part of the issue is time management, part of it faith.  That's a blend that confounds me, sometimes.</p>

<p>I think there may be a bit if a backhanded upside to our current economic situation.&lt;p&gt;The whole mortgage crisis and the credit crunch are awfully complex. People talk of good debt turned bad, of banks that aren’t intetested in foreclosing on homes, of spending billions of taxpayer dollars to help failing businesses. Who knew who Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were before all this started? And who among them knew they were government agencies?&lt;p&gt;A lot of the problems apparently came from very sophisticated financial commodities. Some problems were more simple: people weren’t able to pay their debt. A story on National Public Radio noted that the current total indebtedness of the American people is now at the level of the Gross National Product. The only other recorded time that happened? Just before the Great Depression.&lt;p&gt;My hope is that this crisis will get our attention. We’ve gotten awfully comfortable with debt as a culture, with myself as an example. I, for one, intend to maintain relative financial simplicity. To start living more strictly within my means, even if that means - gasp - lowering my standard of living a little.&lt;p&gt;Some of you think that’s a really obvious choice. I think it’s an oddly foreign concept to my generation. Maybe this is our chance to get our priorities straight.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/14/keyed-up.html">Keyed Up</a></h3>
  <p><p>Ack!  Missed a post.  I’ll double up today.  Storytime.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I found myself getting very nervous, quite stressed out.  There was something on my mind that would have made me anxious anyway, but in the process of trying to calm myself down, I realized something.
</p>
<p>Thus far that day, I'd consumed a large cup of coffee and two sugary pastries.  I'd been listening to punk rock - highly aggressive, noisy, intense music - for around four hours straight.  And I was sitting in front of my computer the whole time, typing, with my shoulders bunched up from my elbows resting on the chair's arms, craning my neck at the papers on my desk, then staring at my glaring backlit monitor.</p>
<p>Whether or not my issue <em>du jour</em> was worth worrying about, my environment was of no help.</p>
<p>So I had lunch with a friend, outside in the sunshine.  Very helpful.  Funny enough, during the course of the conversation, I chuckled, gave her a reassuring little scratch on the back, and told her, "my dear, you gotta learn to relax."</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/07/plot-twists.html">Plot Twists</a></h3>
  <p><p>These days, I consistently feel a little shock of panic when I see the date.  Time is always moving forward a little too fast.  I think I would be less fearful if I had better time management skills.</p>
<p>Today, all I really did was read <em>Watchmen</em>.  Cody loaned me his copy late last night, and I got a few pages in before a late bedtime.  Got up nice and late, and my mid-afternoon, I was well over halfway through.  Running out of a few household essentials - food among them - necessitated a trip to the store, which required me to change out of my PJs.</p>
<p>With my nightly Bible reading a blog post still to do, I was closing in on the ending when the phone rang.  Turns out the person who was going to teach Sunday School tomorrow is sick, and in the end, it fell to me to prepare something for tomorrow morning.  With a small number of teachers available and the number of things we have going on - Sunday School, children's ministry, and a mission committee meeting - situations like this will arise very occasionally.</p>
<p>Michael tells us to keep something ready to teach, just in case.  "Have something in your pocket" is how he puts it.  When the call came, I thought I had nothing.  After a browse through my journals and notes, however, a plan has formed.  Those few minutes of panic, however, called me to account.</p>
<p>So, I'm going to work on translating whatever mental discipline allows me to read an inch-thick graphic novel in a day into my study time, my devotions, and my prayers.  I already have that kind of focus in one area, and I want it in another.  I'll be working on that.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/02/28/whippersnapper.html">Whippersnapper</a></h3>
  <p><p>Sometimes, I feel old for 25.</p>
<p>In stark contrast to a few years ago, there's only one night a week I can reasonably stay up past midnight - Friday, as you might have guessed - and given the option, I often don't.  I've never been a morning person, and I doubt I ever will be, but I have made it work for some time, now.</p>
<p>I was recently part of a discussion about the difference between health and fitness.  To be healthy, the way we typically think of it, is really just to be not-sick.  To be fit is something else altogether, and I can definitely feel the difference.  I'm not dramatically out of shape, but I'm no athlete, either.  Years behind various desks with very minimal exercise in my off hours have seen to that.  One flight of stairs, and my pulse races.  Ten minutes at Sky High, and I need a breather.</p>
<p>I can feel my friendships changing, maybe maturing.  At least, shifting into a more adult mode; that is to say, more occasional.  I just don't see my friends as much as I did in my early college years.  We're all dividing our time between work, school, and at least one other obligation aside from hangout time.  It's normal, but to me, it still seems like a relatively new normal.</p>
<p>I'm getting a sense that I'm entering a time of my life when expectations on me are rising, because of both my age, and my circumstances.  I'm now on staff at my church.  I'm an "analyst" at my day job.  I have more opportunities to make decisions that carry weight.  For whatever reason, that idea also seems relatively novel.</p>
<p>I'm in that odd stage when others, older co-workers especially, alternately treat me like a peer and a youngster.  I still remind women in their forties of their sons, it turns out.  People my parents' age are just now starting to see what my generation is capable of, and some are pretty impressed.  The usual conversation starts out with how easily we pick up technology, then rounds out with how many of us return home in debt.</p>
<p>I've been described as having an "old soul," but I still have some youthful habits and attitudes.  Through it all, my identity is slowly starting to settle.  It can be difficult to accurately track the process from the inside.  If you've got some insight as to how I've changed in recent years, feel free to chime in.</p>

<p>A beautiful start to the day. Doesn't hurt that it's Friday.&lt;p&gt;I've known for some time that I'm called to be selfless, not to worry, and to live life to the full, rather than with a spirit of fear. I tend toward perfectionism, though. Funny how much anxiety that generates, how much fear of your own rejection, and simultaneous judgment of others.&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I'm ready to move on.  And I've been making solid progress.  I'll be spending a lot of time in Romans 8, I think.</p>

  <p><p>I’ve got this girl running through my head.  I don’t know if she exists.  I’ve met some that I thought were her, some that still might be, but then again, might not.  Whether or not she’s real, I’m impatient to meet her.  If that sounds problematic, it is.</p>

<p>Part of my usual walk from my blocks-distant parking spot to Chocolate Fish before work.  At the coffee shop, I read the Bible and journal.  During the walk in, I pray.  Took a bit of my own advice today and was more deliberate in my prayers; more careful to worship along with my requests and troubles.&lt;p&gt;This morning, at least, it made the difference between overexaggerating my few problems and starting the day with peace and, of all things, optimism.</p>

<p>I'm gonna attempt an actual blog post from my phone.  Here goes.&lt;p&gt;Here I sit at Chocolate Fish Coffee once again.  My plan to skip coffee a couple days a week is a go so far, but as you can see, I've lost the added benefit of saving money by picking up an iced white tea instead.  On one hand, the tea is really tasty, and I'd rather not just mooch my favorite coffee shop's patio without buying something.  On the other, I still need to grow my financial discipline.  And every other kind, really.&lt;p&gt;It's doing me a lot of good to get outside.  I'm expecting a scholarly paper on the horrible effects of fluorescent lights on the human soul to come out within the next few years.  It's nice to emerge from the right-angled world of HR - gray with a few scant decorations.  Whether I'm talking about the office or the profession, I'll leave to you.&lt;p&gt;Lately, I've been wishing I could write poetry.  Whenever I try… hmm.  It seems I'm out of room for text.  Well, now I know.  More soon, methinks.</p>

<p>I’m contemplating going to Jakarta, Indonesia over Christmas on a mission trip. Just met with some people at the Starbucks here to discuss details, possibilities. My mind is churning. It’s nice to turn the corner and see something so beautiful.
I’m contemplating a couple things right now that seem like sheer stupidity on the surface. Unless they’re not.</p>

As soon as I discovered my situation, I called into work to let them know I was stranded, and set to work finding a bus route to get to my friend’s house, where my keys and wallet lay happily on the floor.  The route was plotted and I was almost ready to leave when I realized I had no money for bus fare and promptly slapped myself on the forehead.  After a few minutes, I called another compatriot of mine, who agreed to give me a ride when he had a chance.  Thus began the waiting game.</p>
