  <p><p>Maybe it happened in a comic book. Maybe a TV series. Maybe even within a movie. You find a character you like, someone you identify with. You get to know how they work. Then, suddenly, they say a particular line or make a particular choice, and it just feels wrong. <em>They would never do that, </em>you think. You can tell the writer forced the moment in for convenience, or because they were pressured into it. It just doesn’t work.</p>

  <p><p>The Hanukkah travel rush was over, and Bethlehem was quiet again. Hence, the corner where Ben Simon worked the graveyard shift hadn’t seen a car pass in ten minutes. He looked up from his English textbook and peered across the street, to the small booth where his friend Isaiah worked. They had both gotten late-night jobs at gas stations at about the same time, and frequently used faux company loyalty as an excuse to pick on each other. Diagonally across the intersection from Ben was a third gas station manned by Mordecai Steinberg. While Ben and Isaiah had the occasional squeegee fight in the middle of the empty road, Mo usually stuck to his booth dutifully, reading the Torah.</p>

  <p><p>Iskerreth stood before the assembly, manacled. The humans looked on, waiting. Listening. All was imminently silent. The Korrosk soldier straightened his back, his muscles shifting under his scales, his head quills flat against his scalp. He pressed his elbows together in a show of humility, and spoke.</p>

  <p><p>Please forgive the lack of storytime.  I realized, rather suddenly, that I didn’t know nearly enough about the story I’m telling.  The problem with my writing method is the distinct lack of prewriting.  I’ll start into a story without first charting out a plotline, or a setting, or detailed characters.  As a result, I have a lot of fragments of stories, and only a few complete ones.</p>

Still, the case stalked behind him, casting its shadow over him.  He tried to feel the warm night air on his short-furred arms, to listen to the melange of sounds from the clubs and cafes around him, to do anything but think about the investigation.</p>

  <p><p>For a long while, Kleinmann just stood and examined the statue.  The Cult of Masael had decided on this as the central material icon of their religion, and it showed.  The titanic figure was no less than 25 stories tall, and surrounded by strategically placed spotlights which kept the statue permanently illuminated.  Masael was designed to be androgynous, with a narrow, supple physique, but thoroughly muscled.  One great golden hand raised above its shoulders, a clenched fist of victory.  The other hand was pressed against the heart, the head with its effeminate face bowed, chin to chest.  A wave of platinum cords swept over its shoulders, stirring when strong enough winds blew.</p>
