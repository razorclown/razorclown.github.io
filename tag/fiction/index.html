  <h3><a href="/2012/10/28/jesus-vs-cthulhu.html">Jesus vs. Cthulhu</a></h3>
  <p><p>I’m sad that October is almost over. I love this time of year. Fall is here and with Halloween in a few days, we all have an excuse to indulge in some spookiness. As such, I decided to draw the themes for our first XLM weekly Bible studies from horror stories.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2012/02/29/the-real-story.html">The Real Story</a></h3>
  <p><p>Maybe it happened in a comic book. Maybe a TV series. Maybe even within a movie. You find a character you like, someone you identify with. You get to know how they work. Then, suddenly, they say a particular line or make a particular choice, and it just feels wrong. <em>They would never do that, </em>you think. You can tell the writer forced the moment in for convenience, or because they were pressured into it. It just doesn’t work.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2010/12/25/the-first-noel-2010.html">The First Noel, 2010</a></h3>
  <p><p>The Hanukkah travel rush was over, and Bethlehem was quiet again. Hence, the corner where Ben Simon worked the graveyard shift hadn’t seen a car pass in ten minutes. He looked up from his English textbook and peered across the street, to the small booth where his friend Isaiah worked. They had both gotten late-night jobs at gas stations at about the same time, and frequently used faux company loyalty as an excuse to pick on each other. Diagonally across the intersection from Ben was a third gas station manned by Mordecai Steinberg. While Ben and Isaiah had the occasional squeegee fight in the middle of the empty road, Mo usually stuck to his booth dutifully, reading the Torah.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/04/11/quiet.html">Quiet</a></h3>
  <p><p>Golgotha was quiet, and had been for a day.  The guards and the onlookers had long since departed.  The two dead thieves still hung from their crosses, mouths open as though still in a weary plea for mercy.</p>
<p>Only one desperate soul remained on the hill.  Incensed.  Seething.  Muttering hatefully.</p>
<p>"This isn't over... this is <em>not</em> over...."</p>
<p>But he knew it was.  He knew it was over the moment Jesus said it was.  Finished.  Done.  The moment Jesus cried out and took it all.</p>
<p>Had they seen?  They had to have seen him.  The moment he realized that it wasn't his plan that was coming to pass.  That single moment of shock.</p>
<p>When all the sins of the world piled onto God's only son.  When the hideous blackness descended, and was still not enough to block the Glory blazing out from him.  When Jesus breathed his last, and took it all with him.</p>
<p>When all Satan's work fell apart before his very eyes.</p>
<p>He stared at the ground where the cross had been driven.  There, he caught sight of a stone, spattered with blood.  The blood.</p>
<p>Satan roared.  He then took a long, long moment to steady himself.</p>
<p>"This is <em>not</em> over," he snarled, and stormed from the hill.</p>

  <p><p>The thought distantly occurred to Phelps that he had not technically completed the baptism ceremony.  He hadn’t had the time to speak his line - <span style="font-style: italic;">so do I </span>- before the command hit him.  <span style="font-style: italic;">North</span>, said the voice, and north he went.  When the crowds thickened, his run slowed to a very fast walk, dodging between pedestrians and cutting through alleys.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/30/messenger-instructions.html">The Messenger: Instructions</a></h3>
  <p><p>"You knew I was coming," Phelps finally said.</p>
<p>Deacon Mariah smiled, the tiny creases between the thin plates of her face stretching apart.  "A dream," she said, her wispy voice purring over the "r" sound.  "Yeshua's angel."</p>
<p>On the transport had been a congregation of New Lunar Baptists.  After listening to their ravings over the long trip, he had almost gotten used to hearing the Christ called Jesus, rather than Yeshua.  Mariah spoke the name carefully, with reverence.  A far cry, as it were, from the proselytizers on the ship.</p>
<p>Phelps could already tell that Mariah spoke English only with great effort.  But a half-N'aaa priestess in this city...  "Wrri, ihhi tchaun'eh an hal," he said in Nrru.  <em>She told me to come to you.</em></p>
<p>Mariah drew her head back in a serpentine motion, again expressing her surprise.  "And she told me to baptize you," she said simply, in unaccented Nrru.  Even as she spoke, she knelt down and took a handful of green-blue sand.</p>
<p>Phelps froze.  "I... wait..."</p>
<p>The deaconess fixed her blank gaze on him, her hand held high, gently trickling sand.  "It is unbefitting a prophet to be unbaptized.  Will you submit to it?"  She drew herself up, facing him directly.</p>
<p>"I'm not... look, the last time..."</p>
<p>Her hand was suddenly on his chest.  For a moment, he forgot that it was a common N'aaa gesture of friendship.  "Yeshua knows your fears," she was saying.  Gently.  "And he says to you this: you did not leave me there.  I went after you from that place."</p>
<p>The chapel, back in Phoenix.  The guilt.  He was there again.  But now, with her words - with his words - the weight of the memory evaporated.  All at once.  Gone.</p>
<p><em>Oh, Lord...</em> "I will submit to it," Phelps breathed.</p>
<p>Mariah did not hesitate for even a moment.  Phelps' chest tightened as her hand drifted over his shoulders and head, pouring a trail of sand.  "You have one Lord," she said.  "What is his name?"</p>
<p>"Yeshua."  The sand settled on him, and with it, a strange calm.  He held still.</p>
<p>Silence.  In the quiet, the noise of the city far distant, he lost track of time.  Only three seconds passed, but Phelps felt every moment before she spoke again.  "And as he died, so have you," Mariah intoned.  "And..."  She stopped, took a gasp of air.  He could have sworn he heard her giggle.  "And as he lives...."</p>
<p>In response, Phelps tilted his head and leaned back, spilling the sand down his back.  He had barely enough time to register his suprise at how easy the ceremony was after all before the sensation hit.</p>
<p>It was a voice, but not audible.  A compulsion, but not irresistable.  A certainty.  A call.  A command.</p>
<p><em>North</em>.</p>
<p>Phelps hesitated for only an instant.  "Which way is north?" he demanded in Nrru.</p>
<p>Deacon Mariah pointed, and he ran.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/24/messenger-introductions.html">The Messenger: Introductions</a></h3>
  <p><p>St. Luke's Temple was not what Phelps had in mind.  It took him two hours to make the 20-minute walk through New Sidon; two hours of feeble excuses rehearsed over and over, none of which could overcome the weight of the apparition outside the transport window.  He had paced back and forth over the same three blocks, bumping constantly into traders and pilots, and eliciting curses in a dozen languages.  With his training, he could have understood them all, had he been less distracted.</p>
<p>When he finally arrived at the Temple, he thought he might be in the wrong place.</p>
<p>It stood in a gap between two tall pseudocrete buildings, one gaudy orange, the other a matte white.  He had not been thinking of a temple in the N'aaa fashion, certainly not for a temple to Christ.  But there it was, the unwalled patch of blue-green sand, the surface fused into glass and polished.  Like a calm, rolling sea of Earth, frozen between instants.  On the back left corner of the patch sat the arrangement of transluscent red stones, as expected.  But, Phelps noticed with a start, they depicted not the traditional N'aaaian sacred runes, but a cross.</p>
<p>He was about to step onto the undulating glass when he heard the voice.</p>
<p>"Rrrraun i'i'al-hn-cta'i."</p>
<p>The only N'aaa phrase he knew.  Phelps looked down and tried unsuccessfully to hide his surprise at the creature who had addressed him.  She wore a blindfold, a single, wide band of dark green cloth which covered where her nose would be if she were human.  Or rather, full human.  Her skin was more like a carapace - deep brown, with bright white dots like freckles - and her scalp smooth and hairless.  She had four thin fingers on each hand, all of which ended in claws.</p>
<p>And the collar of her polyfiber vest was distinct in its round design.  She was clergy.  A deacon.</p>
<p>"...Deacon Mariah?" he said, mumbled and at a whisper.</p>
<p>The half-N'aaa priestess thrust forward her head in surprise.  Then, she smiled.  "Fel-uufs.  Hallelu."</p>
<p>And once again, Phelps had no words.</p>

  <p><p>"This is impossible," Phelps mumbled inaudibly, pressing himself against the wall opposite the window.</p>
<p>The woman floating outside the window nodded, her arms crossed over her chest.  "It is."  Her voice was in no way muffled by the thick transparent barrier between them.</p>
<p>"How are you-"</p>
<p>"When you arrive in New Sidon, go directly to St. Luke's Temple.  There you will meet Deacon Mariah.  She will give you your instructions."</p>
<p>Phelps gawked at her, mind racing.</p>
<p>Then, she smiled.  "Farewell, prophet."</p>
<p>"Wait!  Wh-"</p>
<p>"All passengers, please secure yourselves for landing.  We will reach the outer atmosphere shortly.  Arrival in New Tyre will be 7:00 am, local time."</p>
<p>Phelps looked up involuntarily at the intercom announcement, then looked back to the window to see nothing but stars.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2006/12/15/introducing-juggler.html">The Juggler</a></h3>
  <p><p>“Do you know the difference between a jester and a clown?”<br /><br />A trickle of blood dripped into Zippy’s eye.  He winced at the stinging pain, shaking his head and blinking rapidly.  “Um… the clown’s tied to a chair, and the jester’s pacing back and forth, holding a knife?”<br /><br />Arvhad halted in his tracks and threw Zippy a hard look.  His left hand tossed and caught one of Zippy’s throwing knives, casually.  A heavy truck rumbled past the warehouse, awkward in the silence.<br /><br />“I was referring to a more general sense,” Arvhad said at last.<br /><br />Zippy shook his head, leaning his head down.  The blood dribbled, slowly and steadily, from the gash on his forehead to the concrete floor.  The red, ink-like streak stood out starkly against Zippy’s paper white skin.<br /><br />“A jester,” Arvhad began, resuming his pacing, “is a trusted advisor in disguise.  He can say things to a king that no one else can.  He can hide truth in jest, and say it straight into the king’s ear.  He has influence, but he wears a foolish mask.”<br /><br />“Or hat,” Zippy smirked.<br /><br />The bells on Arvhad’s jester’s cap rattled as he turned to his captive.  “Precisely.”  Then, he took two swift steps forward and kicked Zippy in the chest.  Zippy’s breath left him in a <i>whoosh</i> as he tilted backwards, teetering past the point of balance and crashing to the floor.  He flexed just in time to land on his elbows rather than his wrists.  Bone-deep pain shot into his shoulders, and he clenched his teeth, straining against the zip-ties on his wrists and ankles.<br /><br />“Now stop interrupting.”<br /><br />“Sorry.  Please go on,” Zippy wheezed.<br /><br />The ratty black scarf hiding Arvhad’s mouth shifted as he grinned, his eyes narrowing.  “Thank you.  So, a jester has influence on kings.  A clown, however, has influence only on the handful of peasants that buy a ticket to the circus.”<br /><br />“See, I don’t sell tickets, though,” Zippy said from the floor.  He shifted his weight to avoid aggravating his bruises. “So I can reach a wider audience.”<br /><br />“Very true,” said Arvhad, turning his pacing around the back of the chair.  He stood over Zippy, looking upside down at his captive, still tossing and catching the dagger.  Then, he stopped.  Slowly, Arvhad shifted the dagger in his gloved hand, pinching the grip between his thumb and forefinger.  He stretched out his arm, dangling the knife above his head, over the bridge of Zippy’s nose.  Zippy’s eyes locked on the point of the blade.<br /><br /> “Perhaps,” said Arvhad, “you’re more of a daredevil with clown makeup.”<br /><br />Zippy’s eyes never left the dagger.  “Uh… maybe.”<br /><br />“There are two things I associate with a daredevil, Zippy.  The need to impress people…”  Arvhad’s hand drifted back and forth, the knife swiveling in his loose grip.  “…and a death wish.”  And as he said the words, he looked up from his captive, spread his fingers wide, and let go.<br /><br />Zippy darted his head to the right, scooting the chair inches to the side.  The dagger landed point-first, digging a chip from the concrete and clattering onto the floor.  Arvhad looked down, unsurprised, as the dagger landed.  Twisting his neck, Zippy could see the knife laying a few inches from his eye.  He found himself breathing hard.<br /><br />“And yet,” Arvhad was saying, “your survival instincts preserve you.”<br /><br />Zippy craned his neck up, and could only barely see the jester.  “I get a lot of practice.”  His voice was unsteady when he spoke.<br /><br />“Exactly.  Exactly my point.”  Arvhad folded his hands neatly in front of him and stared back at the clown.  “Your life is in near-constant danger, because of choices you yourself make.”<br /><br />“I…” Zippy realized he was breathing even harder, through gritted teeth.  Angry, and getting angrier at the sound of the jester’s voice.  <i>Shut up</i>, he thought.<br /><br />Arvhad turned as though he was about to start pacing again, then paused.  He looked back toward his captive, clearly grinning behind his scarf.  “It makes me wonder….”<br /><br />Zippy’s pulse raced.  He looked over at the knife, and a thought occurred to him.  He flexed his arms.<br /><br />“My question is this,” said Arvhad, leaning forward subtly.  “Why, O Razorclown, do you want to die so badly?”<br /><br />The surge in adrenaline served him well.  With a hard shove of his hands and a kick of his bound legs, Zippy rolled himself backwards, thrusting with his neck and shoulders to propel him over.  He landed hard on his knees, gritting his teeth with the pain.  Arvhad only had time to take a single running step before Zippy popped his hips.  He rolled, chair and all, over his left shoulder, in perfect position for one hand up snatch up knife as he bowled into Arvhad’s shins.<br /><br />The jester toppled over the chair and landed hard on the blood-slick floor.  Zippy rolled to a stop on his side, but only long enough to spin the knife in his fingers and saw twice at his bonds, cutting free his hands.  Arvhad regained his feet and looked up just as Zippy, snarling with animal rage, with his ankles still bound to the chair, crouched on the toes of his boots and leapt forward, arms outstretched.  The Razorclown’s tackle drove Arvhad to the cold slab, stealing his wind.  A loud jangle hit the air as the jester’s head smashed against the concrete.<br /><br />It was the last sound Arvhad heard before the blackness.<br /><br />* * *<br /><br />“Sir!”  Kenzo was kneeling next to him.<br /><br />Arvhad sat up sharply, and immediately saw spots.  He clutched his head, blood-encrusted and sore at the back.  “Nnn.  Where is he?”<br /><br />“The Razorclown, sir?  Escaped.  Jumped across the roofs.”<br /><br />Arvhad stood, scooping up his hat and replacing it carefully on his head, covering his short blond hair.  “Right.  Who tied him up?”<br /><br />“Sir, he-”<br /><br />“Initially.”<br /><br />“Oh, yes.”  Kenzo thought for a moment, frowning.  “Rocco.”<br /><br />“Teach him how to restrain someone properly.  Then have him train the rest of the men.”  He looked over at the group of thugs just returning from their failed chase.  Arvhad took a single, deep breath, then reached down and grabbed the chair, setting it upright.  Calmly, he said to the men, “Get to your secondary assignments for the night.  Training session later this week.  Go.”  And they went.<br /><br />Kenzo sighed.  “You want some guys after him?”<br /><br />Gingerly, Arvhad touched the back of his head, wincing very slightly at the pain.  “No.  No, not tonight.  May as well give him some time to stew.”  The hidden smile came to his face again.  “I touched a nerve.”  He reached into the pocket of his leather jacket, and removed a small digital recorder.  He pushed the button.<br /><br />“Profile update.  Zippy the Razorclown.  Physically stronger and more capable even than expected.  Aggressive response when probed about death wish.  Given his background, likely candidate for childhood abuse… or… <i>a-ha</i>.<br /><br />“Survivor’s guilt.”<br /> <style>i{content: normal !important}</style><style>i{content: normal !important}</style><style>i{content: normal !important}</style><style>i{content: normal !important}</style></p>

  <h3><a href="/2006/11/11/razorclown-returns.html">The Razorclown Returns</a></h3>
  <p><p>Brainstorm:<br /><br />[something with Zippy.  setting?<br />(medieval/fantasy)  (modern/urban fantasy)  (futuristic/cyberpunk)<br />maybe a series of short stories of his different incarnations.  that could be cool.  but where to start?  at the beginning, surely.  so, fantasy it is.<br />doing what?<br />start en medias res.  that’s more fun than not.<br />but still, what’s he doing?  ooh!  got one.  fighting a dracolich and its zombie minions.  and he takes it out with [edit for suspense].  heh.<br />probably wanna start with him in midair.  having been whacked?  dodging?<br />how long has he been fighting?  i’m seeing it underground.  that could work.  ooh!  a tomb with a big central chamber.  perfect.<br /><br />game on.]<br /><br /><br /><i>Okay.  No sword.  No magic carpet.  A few knives, a few dried herring, ten flasks of lamp oil, and the Gloves of Fish Ignition.  And no one knows I’m here.</i><br /><br />He lowered his shoulder, ramming past the shambling corpse blocking the narrow walk.  A cloud of dust and dried skin puffed from the zombie as it spun about and tumbled stiffly over the edge.  <i>Zombies everywhere…</i>  Zippy shuddered and checked over his right shoulder, the path before him clear for ten paces.  He squeaked and dived onto his stomach.  The colossal, rotting claws swept over his head, scraping deep grooves in the stone wall behind him.<br /><br /><i>And </i>that<i> thing.</i><br /><br />The dracolich roared in frustration, lurching forward to attack again.  “Die, you accursed clown!”<br /><br />“No!” Zippy shouted back.  The undead dragon’s half-decayed talons swept down from overhead, and he had half an instant to consider.  And as he contemplated the thirty foot drop to the solid rock below, his instincts rolled him over and off the edge of the catwalk.  The dracolich knocked a five-foot section of the wooden walkway into splinters, and  Zippy spun sharply about in midair, raising an arm as the dragon’s arm slammed into him.  Zippy’s head jerked hard, glancing of the monster’s exposed bone.  His vision sparking and his arm numb from the impact, he smashed against the dracolich’s thigh and dropped the remaining ten feet to the ground, feet down.  Expertly, the tucked and rolled, snapping back up to his feet and looking up at his enemy.  His eyes blurred and the room swirled.<br /><i><br />Naw, it’s not worth the risk</i>, he decided three seconds too late.<br />The dracolich swung its gray-black head about, looking for its quarry.  Dizzily, Zippy realized he had landed in a crowd of undead.  No fewer than eight zombies stumbled toward him, dead arms outstretched.  He shook his head, and only got dizzier.<br /><br />The dracolich caught sight of him, and the two locked eyes.<br /><br /><i>Probably should have planned a little better</i>, he thought for the thousandth time.<br /><br />Even as he thought it, a zombie latched on to his backpack from behind.  Zippy tugged, and its grip held firm.<br /><br />“Perhaps you should have thought ahead, fool,” the dracolich rumbled, smiling a jagged, malevolent smile.<br /><br />“I was just thinking the - oh, no,” Zippy said as he saw the dragon’s mouth open wide, its head driving down for the fatal chomp.  For the merest fraction of a moment, Zippy froze.  Then, he swung his arms back and lunged forward, leaping out of his backpack’s straps.  The dracolich snapped shut its jaws, catching only the zombie and the backpack.<br /><br />Zippy rolled over his right shoulder, springing back to a low, ready stance.  The remaining zombies slowly turned toward him, and the dracolich whipped its reptile head about to face him, a broken shin bone protruding from its mouth.  It ground its carnivore teeth together once, and, staring straight at Zippy, swallowed its mouthful.<br /><br />To the dracolich’s amazement, the clown’s jaw dropped - not in fear, but in delight.  “Wow,” Zippy said, lifting one leather-gloved hand.  “Thanks.”  And he snapped his fingers.<br /><br />~<br /><br />The Razorclown grinned and grabbed another biscuit, stuffing the entire pastry in his mouth.  The barmaids waited as he chewed, eager to hear the rest of the story.  After half a minute of chewing, he took a swig of coffee from his tankard and gulped down the lot.  He turned back to his audience, smiling.<br /><br />Silence.<br /><br />“…what?” he asked.<br /><br />“Well?” the farmer in the corner said.  “How’d you beat the dragon?”<br /><br />“I told you!  I snapped my fingers!” Zippy said, holding up his hand.  He wore leather gloves with the middle finger and the thumb cut off, along with an open patch on the palm.  Emblazoned on the back was a curious design of a flaming fish with Xs for eyes.<br /><br />The barkeep snapped his fingers.  “There!  I done the same!  Sure ain’t killed me no zombie dragon!”<br /><br />Zippy shook his head.  “Oh, simple townsfolk.  Don’t you remember?  It ate my backpack!”<br /><br />Silence.<br /><br />“…which was full of fish…“<br /><br />A gasp from the dark-haired barmaid, who nearly spilled the mug she was carrying.  “And lamp oil!”<br /><br />Zippy clapped his hands and pointed to her.  “Someone buy her a cookie!”<br /><br />The farmer in the back got it, and burst into racous laughter.<br /><br />The barkeep lifted an eyebrow at Zippy, and finally, the Razorclown caved.  He reached into his new backpack and pulled out a small salted fish with one hand.  The other he held up for all to see.<br /><br />“Behold, the Gloves of Fish Ignition, my second…” he thought for a moment, “…yeah, second most prized possession.  One snap of the fingers, and any fish… bursts into flame!”  And he snapped.  The herring in his opposite hand was instantly engulfed in blue fire, sizzling and popping with heat.  Zippy calmly dropped the fish into a nearby mug of beer, which emitted a short burst of steam and a very unpleasant odor.<br /><br />“Now,” Zippy continued, dusting off his hands, “What happens when ten flasks of lamp oil are suddenly ignited by ten pickled herring in a dracolich’s throat?”<br /><br />The laughter had already begun.  The light-haired barmaid lifted a fair eyebrow, smirking.  “You don’t mean…“<br /><br />“Yup.”  Zippy smirked back.<br /><br />~<br /><br />The dracolich barely had time to register its surprise before its head was propelled forcefully from its neck.  Zippy yelped and leapt to the side as the smoking skull hurtled past him, crashing into the wall with an echoing <i>crack!</i>  He looked back to see the dracolich’s dead left eye staring at him.  A glutteral sound escaped, somehow, from its mouth, and the head crumbled to dust.  The dracolich’s decapitated body fell to the stone floor, disintegrating on impact.  A collective moan filled the cavern as the entire throng of zombies collapsed, the unclean magic animating them dispelled by the death of the caster.<br /><br />Zippy stood still for a moment, surrounded by dust and corpses.  The echoes faded, and the catacomb was silent.<br /><br /><i>Maybe,</i> he thought, <i>this story will get me some free goodies at the tavern.</i><br /><br />He sneezed at the dust.<style>i{content: normal !important}</style></p>

  <h3><a href="/2006/04/27/song-isnt-just-song-when-its-attached.html">Song Isnt Just Song When Its Attached</a></h3>
  <p><p>A song isn’t just a song when it’s attached to a story.<br /><br />            People didn’t think of that when the first exiles arrived.  They didn’t have much with them – didn’t have time to get anything together.  We’d heard stories of how rich they were.  How much money they spent on things they didn’t even need.  “They’re fat and lazy,” my brother-in-law said once, “and they don’t even work for it.”<br /><br />            They definitely worked hard when they got to the city.  Within the first two days, one family had a fruit stand up and running.  I found out later that my aunt helped them find an old farmer to work with, a guy who needed help getting to the city and back.  For the wage they got, they were doing him a favor.<br /><br />            I stopped by the fruit stand that first morning on the way to work.  Bought an orange.  Two things I’ll always remember about that first time I talked to them: one, the look on the mother’s face.  I looked her in the eye as she handed me my change, and I could tell that she had been crying.  But she smiled at me all the same, and wished me a good day.<br /><br />            Second, they were playing the radio.<br /><br />            Seemed like every time I went by a group of exiles, the radio was going.  Our stations played their music a lot.  It was more popular then than it is now.  So they listened constantly.  It’s like they drank it in, like they needed it.  Once I saw an exile kid wearing these little headphones, and trying to hide something in his pocket, but he kept fiddling with it.  It was one of those little pocket radios, an MP3.  One of the guys from my work saw him and asked him what he had, and he took off.<br /><br />            I was walking back from work two weeks after the first exiles arrived, and the younger sister was running the fruit stand.  Little brother was unloading crates of berries from the old farmer’s truck.  She looked at me when I walked up, and tried to smile, but then, out of nowhere, she just broke down and started weeping.  Mom rushed out and tried to calm her down, and then she was crying too.  And then I realize, the song was playing on the radio.<br /><br />            I’d seen it happen before.  That stupid song comes on, the one with the whiny girl singing about how bad she wants some guy back, the one with the thumpy bass and the annoying synth noises, and the exiles just break down.  They can’t handle it.  We made fun of them for it.<br /><br />            I had to know.  “What is it,” I asked, “about that song?”<br /><br />            They both looked at me, for a moment, like they were going to come across the counter and strangle me.  Then they realized that I just didn’t know.  Mom put her arm around her daughter and looked me in the eye.  Her voice was steady enough that I could understand her through her accent.<br /><br />            She said, “That song was playing when the city fell.”<style>i{content: normal !important}</style></p>

  <p><p>Please forgive the lack of storytime.  I realized, rather suddenly, that I didn’t know nearly enough about the story I’m telling.  The problem with my writing method is the distinct lack of prewriting.  I’ll start into a story without first charting out a plotline, or a setting, or detailed characters.  As a result, I have a lot of fragments of stories, and only a few complete ones.</p>

She giggled and took a step back, looking up at him with her intense dark brown eyes.  As the night wore on, she would be cold in her miniskirt and high-heeled sandals, if she were still outdoors.</p>

  <p><p>For a long while, Kleinmann just stood and examined the statue.  The Cult of Masael had decided on this as the central material icon of their religion, and it showed.  The titanic figure was no less than 25 stories tall, and surrounded by strategically placed spotlights which kept the statue permanently illuminated.  Masael was designed to be androgynous, with a narrow, supple physique, but thoroughly muscled.  One great golden hand raised above its shoulders, a clenched fist of victory.  The other hand was pressed against the heart, the head with its effeminate face bowed, chin to chest.  A wave of platinum cords swept over its shoulders, stirring when strong enough winds blew.</p>
