  <p><p>The Hanukkah travel rush was over, and Bethlehem was quiet again. Hence, the corner where Ben Simon worked the graveyard shift hadn’t seen a car pass in ten minutes. He looked up from his English textbook and peered across the street, to the small booth where his friend Isaiah worked. They had both gotten late-night jobs at gas stations at about the same time, and frequently used faux company loyalty as an excuse to pick on each other. Diagonally across the intersection from Ben was a third gas station manned by Mordecai Steinberg. While Ben and Isaiah had the occasional squeegee fight in the middle of the empty road, Mo usually stuck to his booth dutifully, reading the Torah.</p>

They impotently tried to intimidate the apostles, tried to impose their authority over them.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It took one of their most respected elders to get them to even consider the possibility that the apostles could be doing God’s work.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"&gt;&lt;!--[if !supportLists]--&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Symbol;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;·&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;&lt;span dir="LTR"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Are we more zealous in protecting our own interests than we are in advancing God's?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"&gt;&lt;!--[if !supportLists]--&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Symbol;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;·&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;&lt;span dir="LTR"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Do we miss miracles around us because we're looking for the payoff for ourselves?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNoSpacing"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNoSpacing"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Zeal means dying to oneself.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNoSpacing"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name. – Acts 5:41&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNoSpacing"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNoSpacing"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Peter and John have already been arrested and threatened.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This time, the Sadducees target the apostles as a whole.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They seek to humiliate them by throwing them in jail, then flogging them.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;But even when the apostles are physically beaten, they take it with a smile.  They praise God for the pain, and they don't even slow down.  To them, the Good News is still good, and God continues to empower them to deliver it.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They honestly don’t care what happens to them.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They preach that Jesus is the Lord over everything, and they prove it by their self-sacrifice.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNoSpacing"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNoSpacing"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Gamaliel remembered the rebels of the past, whose followers scattered when things got tough.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;He was content to let the church prove itself.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If it were not God empowering them, they would be like all the others: self-preservation would kick in, and they would go home.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They didn’t back down.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Soon, the Greek word for &lt;i&gt;witness&lt;/i&gt; would give us the word &lt;i&gt;martyr&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNoSpacing"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"&gt;&lt;!--[if !supportLists]--&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Symbol;"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;·&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;&lt;span dir="LTR"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Do your priorities prove your faith?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <h3><a href="/2009/04/11/day-40.html">Day 40</a></h3>
  <p><p>Lent is a season of fasting.  The day before Lent begins is, for some, the biggest party of the year.  In New Orleans, they actually change the rules for Mardi Gras; things that are illegal on any other day of the year are allowed on Fat Tuesday.  May as well live it up now, the logic goes, if we're gonna have to be all pious for a month plus.  At least, that's how it started.  Now, people join the party without knowing why.</p>
<p>The entire point of Lent is to remember.  To understand Easter better, and all that leads up to it.  To deliberately draw near to God.  So I think, if we really had the right perspective, the biggest party of the year would start tomorrow.</p>
<p>It's almost Sunday.  When the fasting ends, and the feast begins.  Remember why.  It's worth celebrating.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/04/11/quiet.html">Quiet</a></h3>
  <p><p>Golgotha was quiet, and had been for a day.  The guards and the onlookers had long since departed.  The two dead thieves still hung from their crosses, mouths open as though still in a weary plea for mercy.</p>
<p>Only one desperate soul remained on the hill.  Incensed.  Seething.  Muttering hatefully.</p>
<p>"This isn't over... this is <em>not</em> over...."</p>
<p>But he knew it was.  He knew it was over the moment Jesus said it was.  Finished.  Done.  The moment Jesus cried out and took it all.</p>
<p>Had they seen?  They had to have seen him.  The moment he realized that it wasn't his plan that was coming to pass.  That single moment of shock.</p>
<p>When all the sins of the world piled onto God's only son.  When the hideous blackness descended, and was still not enough to block the Glory blazing out from him.  When Jesus breathed his last, and took it all with him.</p>
<p>When all Satan's work fell apart before his very eyes.</p>
<p>He stared at the ground where the cross had been driven.  There, he caught sight of a stone, spattered with blood.  The blood.</p>
<p>Satan roared.  He then took a long, long moment to steady himself.</p>
<p>"This is <em>not</em> over," he snarled, and stormed from the hill.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/04/09/later-you-will-understand.html">Later You Will Understand</a></h3>
  <p><p>This is where the story begins to take a turn for the worst.</p>
<p>It's a festival in Jerusalem.  The Jews are celebrating the power of God, eating the Passover meal together as families.  Jesus takes it a step further.  He, God himself, stoops low and washes their feet.  He sets for them an example of humility.  And he commands them, "as I have loved you, so you must love one another." (John 13:34)  A mandate.  Hence, Maundy Thursday.</p>
<p>But only hours later, Jesus is in chains.  The apostles are scattered.  Peter, terrified, is denying that he even knows his friend and master.  The only innocent man is on trial, and will soon be unjustly condemned.</p>
<p>Yet, a plan is unfolding.  Older than Rome, older than Earth, and older than time.  In the beginning, Jesus knew this was coming.  And he accepted it willingly.</p>
<p>Remember that tomorrow.  On the most horrific day ever to be called Good.</p>
<p>"Unless I wash you, you have no part with me." -Jesus (John 13:8)</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/04/06/fridays-coming.html">Friday's Coming.</a></h3>
  <p><p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2012:20-36&amp;version=31">John 12:20-36</a> is intense.  It's a piece of the New Testament  I haven't spent much time studying, but I looked over it tonight in honor of Holy Week.  Easter is coming, and in this passage, no one is more aware of it than Jesus.</p>
<p>When I first looked through Jesus' words and reactions here, it didn't make sense to me.  His words didn't seem to fit together.  And I had no idea why the voice of God would make such a sudden intrusion at such a seemingly innocuous moment.  But it does make sense.</p>
<p>Look at verses 23 and 24.  Jesus knows he has to die to fulfill his purpose on earth.  And he's not looking forward to it (verse 27).  Even so, "Father, glorify your name."  That's his choice.  To make the sacrifice for us, knowing the pain he has yet to endure.  This is no small moment.</p>
<p><em>Then  a voice came from heaven: "I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again." The crowd that stood there and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said,  "An angel has spoken to him." Jesus answered,  "This voice has come for your sake, not mine." -</em>John 12:28-30 (ESV)</p>
<p>There's a lot to celebrate this week, in which God displayed His humility and love.

  <h3><a href="/2009/04/03/by-your-love.html">By Your Love</a></h3>
  <p><p>In Jordan, publicly preaching the Christian faith is illegal.  This we learned from two missionary friends who gave us a presentation in Bible study last night.  They've lived in the Middle East for two years, now, and have met with some success in their mission.</p>
<p>How?  By openly defying the Jordanian government and boldly preaching the Word on every streetcorner? I mean, really, isn't that what missionaries are supposed to do?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>They make friends.  They get involved in the community.  They serve in the local Arab Christian church.  They love people, and take care of people.  And when the opportunity arises to speak openly about Jesus, when someone asks a question about faith or requests an Arabic copy of the Bible... they do.</p>
<p>They've discovered in a new way the power of Christian fellowship.  Of people just loving one another and serving God across cultures, races, and national boundaries.  I'm glad for their example.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/18/when-as-yet-there-were-none.html">When As Yet There Were None</a></h3>
  <p><p> For you  formed my inward parts;
 you  knitted me together in my mother’s womb.
 I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. 
 Wonderful are your works;
 my soul knows it very well.
 My frame was not hidden from you,
 when I was being made in secret,
 intricately woven in  the depths of the earth.
 Your eyes saw my unformed substance;
 in your  book were written, every one of them,
 the days that were formed for me,
 when as yet there were none of them.</p>
<p>Psalms 139:13-16 (ESV)
</p>
<p>If you drew hard theology from this passage, you might make some conclusions about predestination and free will.  But this is a poem.  A song.  That's what a Psalm is.  It's not the best place to determine the specific workings of the spiritual.  It is, however, the perfect place to learn to worship.
</p>
<p>Sometimes God makes right turns.  We think we know exactly where He's headed, and the path He'll take us along to get there.  One thing you learn quickly when you try to follow God is that He loves off-roading.</p>
<p>Even though He's God, it's really easy to get annoyed at Him.  To doubt Him.  We get awfully attached to our own visions of our own lives, and when He - politely or not - informs us that He has a different vision, we tend to get up in arms.</p>
<p>In Psalm 139, David recognizes what we so readily forget.  A simple fact that changes everything when we actually believe it.</p>
<p>God loves us, and He knows what He's doing.</p>

  <p><p>My entry tonight is just my notes from tonight’s Bible study. Ashley’s 
lesson could have been written specifically for me.&lt;p&gt;2 Thess 3:6-13
-do not grow weary of doing good.&lt;p&gt;Idleness. Aimlessness. (sloth.)
-is not Christlike.
-is appealing, and influential to others.
   -1 thess 5:14 - admonish the idle
-doesn’t mix with initiative.
   -God isn’t into gray areas.
-is unfruitful by nature.
-drains away integrity.
-is not defeated merely by intent, but by action.
-is hypocritical.
   -Take up your cross and follow me.
-drains resources and contributes nothing.
-hinders God’s work.
-neuters our calling.&lt;p&gt;Am I occupied with God’s purpose?
What do I have to show for my work?
What’s coming out of my mouth? (aha.)
   -Defensive? Judgmental? Gossip?&lt;p&gt;“There’s no unemployment for spirituality.” -Shane&lt;p&gt;Gal. 6:9 - at the proper time, we will reap a harvest if we do not 
give up.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/10/scatterer.html">The Scatterer</a></h3>
  <p><p>18  “Hear then the parable of the sower: 19 When anyone hears the word of  the kingdom and  does not understand it,  the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path. 20 As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately  receives it with joy, 21 yet he has no root in himself, but  endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately  he falls away. 22 As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but  the cares of  the world and  the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. 23 As for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and  understands it. He indeed  bears fruit and yields, in one case  a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.” </p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/09/overcome.html">Overcome</a></h3>
  <p><p>There are a few stories in the Bible I can hardly finish telling without choking up.</p>
<p>Jesus took two of his disciples, two of his closest friends, up on a mountaintop with him.  There, the Bible says that as they watch, Jesus illuminates, literally glowing, and two long-dead prophets appear to speak with him.  Completely awestruck and terrified, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%209:5-6;&amp;version=31;">words fail</a>.  The men are surrounded by a cloud, from which the voice of God the Father boom.  Then, silence.  They look around.  Just Jesus.  In my mind, this is where Jesus grins and starts walking nonchalantly down the hill, then looks over his shoulder at them and says, "Well?  You coming?"</p>
<p>Here's the part of the story where I have trouble talking.</p>
<p>They get to the bottom of the hill, and they hear arguing.  There's a man there, with his son.  The religious leaders and <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Jesus'</span> followers are shouting back and forth, but when they see Jesus, they come running.  It turns out the man brought his son to <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Jesus'</span> disciples to be healed of his seizures.  The disciples tried, and failed.  As Jesus watches, the boy falls to the ground, convulsing violently.  In the midst of all the turmoil, with the crowd looking on, the father says, "If you can do anything, take pity on us and help us."</p>
<p>"If?" Jesus says.  He tells him, "Everything is possible for him who believes."</p>
<p>Here is the father's response, as recorded in Mark 9:24:</p>
<p><em>Immediately the boy's father exclaimed, "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"</em></p>
<p>That's me.  I know that place.</p>
<p>If you've ever had your trust betrayed, you know.  If you've ever been wearied by disappointment, you know.  If you've been reduced to hope without expectation, you know what he meant.  If you've been given every reason to doubt, you understand.</p>
<p>So, what does Jesus do with this man?  With this broken, hopeless, desperate man?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%209:24-27;&amp;version=31;">He grants both his requests</a>.</p>
<p>I pray we never stop at doubt.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/05/tonight-was-another-amazing-night-at.html">Of Dogs</a></h3>
  <p><p>Tonight was another amazing night at Bible study.  Ashley’s lesson was out of <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark%207:24-30;&amp;version=31;">Mark 7:24-30</a>, one of the most challenging passages in the Bible.  In it, Jesus miraculously heals a pagan woman’s daughter because she comes to him with extreme humility.  It’s a very deep story, with a lot of cultural and historical subtleties - which, in the context of the original story, weren’t subtle at all.  We focused mainly on two ideas: that Jesus offends the proud, but shows mercy on the humble.</p>

  <p><p>I thought this deserved a seperate post.  This verse came up in a conversation with my friend Jeremy, and I realized it fits in perfectly with my <a href="http://razorclown.blogspot.com/2006/12/wretch.html">earlier post on self-loathing</a>:<br /><br /><i>Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.</i> See what this godly sorrow has produced in you: what earnestness, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what concern, what readiness to see justice done. At every point you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter.   -2 Corinthians 7:10-11 (emphasis mine)<br /><br />If your conscience is bothering you, it’s God speaking.  Take that guilt, and turn it toward repentance, and, having served its purpose, the guilt should by all means go away.<br /><br />If you hate yourself, it’s not God speaking.  Seek Him out, and He’ll tell you.<br /><style>i{content: normal !important}</style><style>i{content: normal !important}</style><style>i{content: normal !important}</style></p>

  <h3><a href="/2006/12/06/wretch.html">Wretch.</a></h3>
  <p><p>Sometimes, I seriously hate myself.<br /><br />I say this because, for one, it’s the truth.  It doesn’t take much for me to get down on myself. One mistake, whether it’s a minor verbal slip or a major lapse in judgment, and I’m growling at myself inwardly.  When I give my best effort, and it isn’t enough - or worse, my best effort only makes the situation worse - I want to punish myself for being such a screw-up.<br /><br />The main reason I say this is because I’ve seen several of my friends post similar comments on their blogs, and I want them to know they’re not alone.  Not by far.<br /><br />I have a lot to learn about how to love myself, particularly being able to forgive myself for mistakes.  God is teaching me, and I’m slowly learning.  It’s not easy.  As it turns out, there’s a reason we sing Amazing Grace.  The title of the song isn’t “Well-Earned Grace.”  No such thing.  It’s amazing that God dispenses his grace to us, even though we mess up so very often.<br /><br />Here’s my problem: I focus so much on the “amazing” part, I miss the essence.  <i>Grace</i>.<br /><br />“Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die. But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” -Paul, Romans 5:7-8<br /><br />I do God a grave disservice by beating up on myself.  The only place for guilt and shame in my life is as an indicator that it’s time to repent.  That’s it.  Learn, turn, and move on.<br /><br />God’s love is greater than my failings.  In him, I have hope to learn from my errors and grow beyond my own <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">miniscule</span> power.<br /><br />I’ll be praying.  That our attitudes toward ourselves won’t hold us back.  That our anger toward ourselves will be momentary and constructive.  And that God himself will show us a love greater than our mistakes.<br /><br />How sweet the sound.<style>i{content: normal !important}</style></p>
