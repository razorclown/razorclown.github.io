  <h3><a href="/2010/02/22/splashdown.html">Splashdown</a></h3>
  <p><p>The Private marched, smiling easily, in front of the rumbling war machine, his grip loose on his rifle.  He looked over his right shoulder at the steadily churning treads and breathed deep.  Ionized exhaust rippled from the tank in waves, heating and sterilizing the air.  He caught a glare from his Sergeant, and looked forward again, standing up straighter.  Still, he smiled.  The bridge and road ahead looked clear for miles.</p>

  <p><p>Officer Feinman wished he had gotten more rest before the operation had started.  He was on his fifth cup of coffee when the Goliath squads reported in.  His palmtop vibrated, and he flipped it open to read the reports.  A few more separatist scouts picked off, a few inches of progress on the main front on the west edge of the city.  Three more clones lost in combat.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2010/02/19/the-west-approach.html">The West Approach</a></h3>
  <p><p>The scout slid through a gap in the shattered wall and into the street.  He ducked behind a charred truck, his gray cloak only barely fluttering.  Concrete dust had settled over everything, and when the scout stood still, he was all but invisible.  Nothing moved for miles in either direction.  The only sound was distant gunfire, far to the west.</p>
