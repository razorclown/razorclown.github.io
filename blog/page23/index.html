<p>I think there may be a bit if a backhanded upside to our current economic situation.&lt;p&gt;The whole mortgage crisis and the credit crunch are awfully complex. People talk of good debt turned bad, of banks that aren’t intetested in foreclosing on homes, of spending billions of taxpayer dollars to help failing businesses. Who knew who Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were before all this started? And who among them knew they were government agencies?&lt;p&gt;A lot of the problems apparently came from very sophisticated financial commodities. Some problems were more simple: people weren’t able to pay their debt. A story on National Public Radio noted that the current total indebtedness of the American people is now at the level of the Gross National Product. The only other recorded time that happened? Just before the Great Depression.&lt;p&gt;My hope is that this crisis will get our attention. We’ve gotten awfully comfortable with debt as a culture, with myself as an example. I, for one, intend to maintain relative financial simplicity. To start living more strictly within my means, even if that means - gasp - lowering my standard of living a little.&lt;p&gt;Some of you think that’s a really obvious choice. I think it’s an oddly foreign concept to my generation. Maybe this is our chance to get our priorities straight.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/14/keyed-up.html">Keyed Up</a></h3>
  <p><p>Ack!  Missed a post.  I’ll double up today.  Storytime.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I found myself getting very nervous, quite stressed out.  There was something on my mind that would have made me anxious anyway, but in the process of trying to calm myself down, I realized something.
</p>
<p>Thus far that day, I'd consumed a large cup of coffee and two sugary pastries.  I'd been listening to punk rock - highly aggressive, noisy, intense music - for around four hours straight.  And I was sitting in front of my computer the whole time, typing, with my shoulders bunched up from my elbows resting on the chair's arms, craning my neck at the papers on my desk, then staring at my glaring backlit monitor.</p>
<p>Whether or not my issue <em>du jour</em> was worth worrying about, my environment was of no help.</p>
<p>So I had lunch with a friend, outside in the sunshine.  Very helpful.  Funny enough, during the course of the conversation, I chuckled, gave her a reassuring little scratch on the back, and told her, "my dear, you gotta learn to relax."</p>

  <p><p>My entry tonight is just my notes from tonight’s Bible study. Ashley’s 
lesson could have been written specifically for me.&lt;p&gt;2 Thess 3:6-13
-do not grow weary of doing good.&lt;p&gt;Idleness. Aimlessness. (sloth.)
-is not Christlike.
-is appealing, and influential to others.
   -1 thess 5:14 - admonish the idle
-doesn’t mix with initiative.
   -God isn’t into gray areas.
-is unfruitful by nature.
-drains away integrity.
-is not defeated merely by intent, but by action.
-is hypocritical.
   -Take up your cross and follow me.
-drains resources and contributes nothing.
-hinders God’s work.
-neuters our calling.&lt;p&gt;Am I occupied with God’s purpose?
What do I have to show for my work?
What’s coming out of my mouth? (aha.)
   -Defensive? Judgmental? Gossip?&lt;p&gt;“There’s no unemployment for spirituality.” -Shane&lt;p&gt;Gal. 6:9 - at the proper time, we will reap a harvest if we do not 
give up.</p>

  <p><p>18  “Hear then the parable of the sower: 19 When anyone hears the word of  the kingdom and  does not understand it,  the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path. 20 As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately  receives it with joy, 21 yet he has no root in himself, but  endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately  he falls away. 22 As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but  the cares of  the world and  the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. 23 As for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and  understands it. He indeed  bears fruit and yields, in one case  a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.” </p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/09/overcome.html">Overcome</a></h3>
  <p><p>There are a few stories in the Bible I can hardly finish telling without choking up.</p>
<p>Jesus took two of his disciples, two of his closest friends, up on a mountaintop with him.  There, the Bible says that as they watch, Jesus illuminates, literally glowing, and two long-dead prophets appear to speak with him.  Completely awestruck and terrified, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%209:5-6;&amp;version=31;">words fail</a>.  The men are surrounded by a cloud, from which the voice of God the Father boom.  Then, silence.  They look around.  Just Jesus.  In my mind, this is where Jesus grins and starts walking nonchalantly down the hill, then looks over his shoulder at them and says, "Well?  You coming?"</p>
<p>Here's the part of the story where I have trouble talking.</p>
<p>They get to the bottom of the hill, and they hear arguing.  There's a man there, with his son.  The religious leaders and <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Jesus'</span> followers are shouting back and forth, but when they see Jesus, they come running.  It turns out the man brought his son to <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Jesus'</span> disciples to be healed of his seizures.  The disciples tried, and failed.  As Jesus watches, the boy falls to the ground, convulsing violently.  In the midst of all the turmoil, with the crowd looking on, the father says, "If you can do anything, take pity on us and help us."</p>
<p>"If?" Jesus says.  He tells him, "Everything is possible for him who believes."</p>
<p>Here is the father's response, as recorded in Mark 9:24:</p>
<p><em>Immediately the boy's father exclaimed, "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"</em></p>
<p>That's me.  I know that place.</p>
<p>If you've ever had your trust betrayed, you know.  If you've ever been wearied by disappointment, you know.  If you've been reduced to hope without expectation, you know what he meant.  If you've been given every reason to doubt, you understand.</p>
<p>So, what does Jesus do with this man?  With this broken, hopeless, desperate man?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%209:24-27;&amp;version=31;">He grants both his requests</a>.</p>
<p>I pray we never stop at doubt.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/07/plot-twists.html">Plot Twists</a></h3>
  <p><p>These days, I consistently feel a little shock of panic when I see the date.  Time is always moving forward a little too fast.  I think I would be less fearful if I had better time management skills.</p>
<p>Today, all I really did was read <em>Watchmen</em>.  Cody loaned me his copy late last night, and I got a few pages in before a late bedtime.  Got up nice and late, and my mid-afternoon, I was well over halfway through.  Running out of a few household essentials - food among them - necessitated a trip to the store, which required me to change out of my PJs.</p>
<p>With my nightly Bible reading a blog post still to do, I was closing in on the ending when the phone rang.  Turns out the person who was going to teach Sunday School tomorrow is sick, and in the end, it fell to me to prepare something for tomorrow morning.  With a small number of teachers available and the number of things we have going on - Sunday School, children's ministry, and a mission committee meeting - situations like this will arise very occasionally.</p>
<p>Michael tells us to keep something ready to teach, just in case.  "Have something in your pocket" is how he puts it.  When the call came, I thought I had nothing.  After a browse through my journals and notes, however, a plan has formed.  Those few minutes of panic, however, called me to account.</p>
<p>So, I'm going to work on translating whatever mental discipline allows me to read an inch-thick graphic novel in a day into my study time, my devotions, and my prayers.  I already have that kind of focus in one area, and I want it in another.  I'll be working on that.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/07/dude-who-shot-me.html">Dude, Who Shot Me?</a></h3>
  <p><p>Once again, the boys gathered at Pastor Holmes' place to play Call of Duty on the XBox. This is the second time just recently that I've had a laugh-out-loud good time with a group of guy friends pretending to shoot each other. The girls tend to leave the room.</p>
<p>The Call of Duty series, and other games like it, offers two things guys love: violence and competition. There's some odd appeal to launching a grenade far across a field to land at your friend's feet, who you didn't even see, but who would have done the same to you if he had the chance. I also appreciate that while the games have big, loud guns, the gore is quite minimal. The latest installment ramps it up quite a bit, but it's still fantasy violence, where only your pride gets hurt when you get shotgunned.</p>
<p>Really, it's not to be overthought. It's just dang fun.</p>

  <h3><a href="/2009/03/05/tonight-was-another-amazing-night-at.html">Of Dogs</a></h3>
  <p><p>Tonight was another amazing night at Bible study.  Ashley’s lesson was out of <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark%207:24-30;&amp;version=31;">Mark 7:24-30</a>, one of the most challenging passages in the Bible.  In it, Jesus miraculously heals a pagan woman’s daughter because she comes to him with extreme humility.  It’s a very deep story, with a lot of cultural and historical subtleties - which, in the context of the original story, weren’t subtle at all.  We focused mainly on two ideas: that Jesus offends the proud, but shows mercy on the humble.</p>
