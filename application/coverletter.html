        <h2>Ms. Hong,</h2>
        <p class="intro">I hereby apply for the Associate Information Systems Analyst (Specialist) position at the California Victim Compensation Board.</p>
        <p>Since the beginning of my service as webmaster for the Board in late 2011, I have taken it as my duty not only to fulfill the requirements of the service requests that come to me, but to proactively improve the functionality, look, and performance of our website.</p>
        <p>Shortly after I became webmaster, I independently reviewed the existing State template with its fixed-with layout and developed code to make it responsive to a variety of screen sizes. With leadership's approval, I implemented a responsive design for our website two and a half years before the official responsive State template was released.</p>
        <p>When the official State template is updated, it is released in a format that the Board cannot use with its current server setup. I successfully adapted the template to work with our servers and presented my technique to the Webmaster User Group.</p>
        <p>I have also contributed several bug reports to the State template, including one for a feature that did not work and another that resulted in a significant performance improvement.</p>
        <p>In 2013, I undertook a redesign of the calvcp.ca.gov homepage. I used analytics data and the contributions of CalVCP staff and leadership to create a user-friendly first stop for crime victims as they access the program.</p>
        <p>If offered this position, I will continue that philosophy of constant improvement through analysis and collaboration.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p class="signature">Brian Armitage</p>
