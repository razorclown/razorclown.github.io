    <p>This week… what can I say?  If I don’t stay motivated this week, there will be problems.</p>

<p>I have a movie to make.  Time has been allocated tomorrow for the filming process.  Editing time is questionable at best.  Hopefully, none will be needed: the idea I have could potentially be filmed in one continuous take (but certainly not the <i>first</i> take).  The idea fits the one-take format… but could necessity is the mother of invention, they say.</p>

<p>I have a story to write.  Six more pages by Friday.  I have an idea, characters, a general plot, themes, motifs, something of a setting… just need momentum.  Six more pages by Friday.  Good ones.</p>

<p>I have a derelict car to dispose of.  That needs to happen tomorrow.  Tomorrow morning, no less.  My friends can attest to my wretched history with cars.  This one, I literally can’t <i>give</i> away.  If it is not gone by Wednesday, my head will be unceremoniously be fed to Koby, our German shepherd.  I intend to deny the dog the satisfaction.  Mutt.</p>

<p>If today is any indication, I can pull all this off.  I did more things today than I’ve done in the past week, practically.  And it feels wonderful.</p>

<p>Lately I’ve re-realized how laziness can devour my life.  There’s an African proverb that goes, “Sitting is being crippled.”  I’ve often wondered at my more active friends (which seems to be just about everyone), and how much they get done in a given day.  Sometimes it genuinely boggles my mind.</p>

<p>I truly hope I can join their ranks soon.  This week might just help.</p>
