   <p>When I left the formal ministry just under a year ago, it was with an incredible sense of relief. Incredible not just because of its magnitude, but because of the hurricane of angst and doubt that led up to my decision.</p>

<p>I wasn’t walking away from my faith. Not at all. The angst arose from the idea that leaving the pastoral position I was in would offend God and derail me from the plan He had for me. I was afraid that I would be failing my God, my family, my church, and myself. I was afraid that I would be ruining my life.</p>

<p>Just under a year later, it hasn’t ruined my life. It hasn’t demolished my faith or my family. It has, however, exposed a whole lot of damage that I couldn’t see clearly while I was a pastor. Not that the position was the problem — it was my perspective on it.</p>

<p>My pastoral career was marked by more fear and misery than joy. As afraid as I was to fail in leaving my position, I was constantly afraid of failing while I was in the position. That my pastor and boss was a perfectionist was only part of it. Any criticism or correction confirmed my greatest fear, over and over: that I had become a spiritual leader not because of a divine calling, but because of a clerical error, a flaw in the process.</p>

<p>I was neck-deep in impostor syndrome, and it was draining the life out of me.</p>

<p>I had been living with unanswered doubts around my call to ministry ever since it began. When I initially interviewed with my local church board to be included in the ministerial preparation process, I was sure they would tell me to come back when I was more sure that God was directing me. When an experienced pastor told me that “you have to know that you know that you know” that you’re called to ministry, I froze inside. I never, at any point, had that level of confidence or clarity that God wanted me to become a minister.</p>

<p>I constantly judged myself based on those questions. As I learned and tried my hand at ministry, every failure, every mistake convinced me that I wasn’t where I was so that I could become a productive, fruitful minister. After several years of being a pastor, and, in my eyes, dramatically underperforming, I had all but convinced myself that God has brought me to where I was so that I could serve as a negative example to the other ministerial students around me. I thought I was a living illustration of what not to do.</p>

<p>I literally thought that my purpose in ministry was to test the patience of the “real” ministers around me, the ones God had actually ordained to succeed.</p>

<p>Paradoxically, I never doubted that God had called me to the church and the situation where I became a pastor. I still don’t, though I think I may understand His call better in hindsight.</p>

<p>We had gone over to the church property to pray over it and listen for God’s direction. A group of us were considering leaving our current church to go there, but we weren’t going to make the choice lightly. As I prayed, I asked God if I should make the change.</p>

<p>There are only a few moments in my life where I am fully confident that God spoke a particular phrase to me such that I heard it distinctly in my mind. This was one. I asked, and God said, “You don’t have to do this.”</p>
