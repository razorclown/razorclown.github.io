      <p>A pass-off story, written July 16 – August 5, 2008 on the Knoll Forum.</p>

  <section data-author="zippy">

<p>Zippy swirled the blue liquid in the glass, eyeing it suspiciously. Smelled sweet enough, but those tiny, steadily rising bubbles were troublesome. They said it was safe, that it was in fact delicious, and had no magical properties. But the last time someone told him that, he had to enlist an entire school of wizards to research de-polymorph magic.</p>

<p>Ah, well. Zippy tilted back the glass and gulped.</p>

<p>“Mmm! Fizzy! And… ooh! Okay, I like.” He grinned widely across the table and poured more of the fluid from its bottle. “So, where do these Fu Fu Berries grow? I want my very own tree.”</p>


</section>

<section data-author="duckmu">


<p>“I’m pretty sure they aren’t real. I’ve been around for thousands of years and I’ve never heard of Fu Fu Berries!” Helward snatched up the bottle and studied the label carefully. He mouthed the words slowly, following under each with his finger.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, never mind. Says so right there.” He pointed to a bold section on the label that read “Yeah, Fu Fu Berries are totally real. We’re not making that up.” He took a quick sip of the delectable pinkish liquid. “Not half bad. Not even a quarter bad.”</p>


</section>

<section data-author="dmoney">


<p>The door to the men’s room swung open and a figure emerged from it adjusting his shirt and tie as another figure was head first in the toilet. “ I hate deadbeats who don’t pay me my money, stupid mooley!”</p>

<p>He sat down at a table as sound emitted from his pocket, he regained his composure before he pulled out his cell phone to answer “Hello? Oh hi Grandmama how are…” a loud voice cut Joey off and a scowl grew on his face, “I told you I had to go out on business and I’d…No I’m not putting nuthin’ up my nose no more Grandma, I know I know it’s bad for my health.” He nods his head a couple more times as if she were standing right there, he sighs “I’ll go look after Luigi I promise, oh I’m about to drive under a tunnel so I gotta go bye Grandmama.” He hangs up quickly and looks around for some service.</p>


</section>

<section data-author="oster">


<p>A deaf, blind wolf-like man stumbled into the bar, feeling his way along with a quarter staff. Pausing when the staff hit the end of the bar, the kobold monk felt for the counter, and moved along it until he found a seat. Awkwardly, the dog-man-thing sat down and “looked” about from under his wide brimmed rice hat, even though he had a bandage over his eyes and giant cotton balls shoved in his ears.</p>


</section>

<section data-author="zippy">


<p>“Wait, that one’s the Fu Fu Berry? Oh, right.” He lifted the Jones bottle and squinted at it. “I still can’t read English that… good. This must be Berry Lemonade. Mmm. Then I want a berrylemon tree instead. Oh, hey! The monk showed up! Over here!” Zippy waved, then paused. “Oh, right. So, who’s running this meeting, anyway?” His eyes drifted to the folder sitting on the table in front of him, stuffed haphazardly full of important documents. “Oh, right.” He rubbed his eyes. “Hopping dimensions makes me sleepy. Okay, <em>order</em>!”</p>


</section>

<section data-author="duckmu">


<p>“Wait! Meeting? What are we meeting about? All I was told was that there would be cake and beverages. Where is the…” and there it was, as if summoned up by the narrator. A chocolate funfetti cake, dripping with light red funfetti frosting. It glowed with a holy radiance that rivaled a large florescent light being run with extra radioactive electricity. The cake smelled strangely of cherry blossoms and a crisp Spring breeze flowing over a mountain stream…“That is the most beautiful thing” Helward ran his hand under his eye “I have ever seen. “</p>

<p>Oh the verge of sobbing he turned away as his hand, moving of it’s own accord of course, began to cut heaping slices of the cake and dole them out. The hand passed one to the man in charge of the meeting, one to the crying assassin, and left a third piece at an empty chair at their same table.</p>

<p>“The cake wasn’t a lie.” He turned to his plate of cake and began to eat. “Ok, lets meet.”</p>


</section>

<section data-author="oster">


<p>The monk’s head bobbed slightly as the blind kobold drummed his fingers on the table, as if “hearing” whatever beat he was taping out in his memories.</p>


</section>

<section data-author="crwuidth">


<p>At that moment, in through the door burst a tallish, stocky man in an eyepatch and a badly singed peacoat. In his right hand he held a long, wicked-looking black machete. The other arm looked to have been recently put out, and was still gripping to what looked to be the handle of another blade, only the blade was all but melted away. Panting a moment to catch his breath, the pirate (for pirate he was) cursed bitterly.</p>

<p>“Hell an’ a half! That was m’ defendin’ arm!”</p>


</section>

<section data-author="oster">


<p>The gnoll monk might’ve been deaf, but he could still feel the floor rock with approaching danger. The monk cocked his head, ear raising reflexively despite being deaf.</p>

<p>“Mrrrrrm?” the gnoll said, looking blindly over his shoulder.</p>


</section>

<section data-author="crwuidth">


<p>The pirate took in the bar and its patrons at a glance, and nodded appreciatively.</p>

<p>“Yeh, you lot won’ do ‘alf bad.” He jerked a thumb back over his shoulder, dropping the ruined machete where he stood.</p>

<p>“Zombie swarm. Comin’ this way. Managed t’ firebomb a good few o’ th’ bastards, bu’ th’ rest kept comin’.” He paused a breath and frowned deeply as though realizing an equally troubling problem for the first time. “Tha’ was me only flask o’ grog, too. i hope yer all f’milliar wi’ zombies?”</p>


</section>

<section data-author="zippy">


<p>Zippy blinked twice, then turned to the table. “So ordered. Meeting adjourned.” He swept the Clownrazor from its scabbard and charged out the door. “LET’S GET ‘EM, CRUD-WITH! YAAAAHHH!” His footsteps echoed up the hidden stairwell. Distantly, a door slammed.</p>

<p>Faint sounds of epic zombie battle drifted down from K Street above. The car alarm on a PT Cruiser shrilled, and was suddenly silenced.</p>


</section>

<section data-author="duckmu">


<p>Helward looked up at the pirate then the stairway that the clown just blindly charged up then back to the pirate. “Have some cake.” He nodded to the empty chair with a piece of cake waiting at it. “S’real good.” He wenk back to his cake, listening to the epic zombie that would surely be over soon. “How many zombies are there anyway?”</p>


</section>

<section data-author="crwuidth">


<p>The pirate shook his head, shrugging mildly. “After th’ ones i torched, no more’n four, five dozen. He’ll be back ‘fore ye know it.”</p>

<p>Giving the gnoll a quizzical look, Cwruidth helped himself to a piece of cake and wandered toward the back hall to find an Ecstatic Cultist who could direct him to ingredients for more Ultragrog.</p>


</section>

<section data-author="zippy">


<p>A few minutes passed. and Zippy stomped back down the stairs, trailing blood and other goo. His pallid hair was matted against his scalp. “There were only, like, fifty left! Come on, Crud-with!” He grabbed a napkin and wiped his enchanted blade, leaving a small clean streak on the grimy steel. “Hmm. Hey, does <em>Sack-Toe</em> have a big zombie problem, or is it mostly rogue wizards and stuff?”</p>


</section>

<section data-author="crwuidth">


<p>Back in the corner, Cwruidth gave an apologetic shrug as he tipped various bottles down a funnel into an oil drum.
“Most o’ wha’ i put in th’ flask was sommat a bloke called ‘liquid pro-pain.’ Sounded promising at th’ time. i ‘ad no way o’ knowin’ if ye use it fer fightin’ ‘staid o’ drinkin, it takes all th’ fun out of it. Last i heard, mos’ the zombies they get roun’ here are fake ones, an’ ever since some lads named Michael an’ Lance vampires are scarce as ye please. Big problem lately’s been th’ c.h.u.d.s.”</p>


</section>

<section data-author="laggy">


<p>Eve sticks her head into the bar looking for the beastman. She cautiously scans the counter, eyes him and ducks back out of the door.</p>

<p>“First zombies and now another beastman sighting…” she mutters to herself. “ I’m sure to get that promotion.”</p>

<p>She straightens her shirt, runs her fingers through her hair and brushes the dirt off her jeans before entering the bar. She calmly walks to a booth in the far corner of the room while keeping an eye on the kobold. She sits down, pulls a notebook from her back pocket and a pen from behind her ear. She scans the room again and her eyes widen as she sees the other occupants for the first time. Her head lowers and she starts writing furiously.</p>

<p>“<em>…The beastman was found again in the bar on K Street. Possible headline tomorrow:</em> Alcoholic beastmen invade Sacramento?… <em>Clown seen slaughtering zombies;</em> Savior in Disguise?… <em>Man in bar talks to cake, possible controlled by mafia pirates… supernatural masters meet up to plan world domination…</em>”</p>


</section>

<section data-author="zippy">


<p>“It’s not a disguise. This is what I really look like,” Zippy said, peering over her shoulder.</p>


</section>

<section data-author="dmoney">


<p>“WHAT ZOMBIES!!!?” Joey spit up cake as he had come to from his sugar induced comatose, “There’s no way I’m doing any of that again not after the last time I delt with a city full of ‘em. I’m going back to New York before this happens again.” He sets down his fork and nods to the wise guy who handed him such a delicious cake “Grazie”, the back door couldn’t shut quick enough behind him and he was gone as all that was left was a decent lookin’ after image.</p>


</section>

<section data-author="laggy">


<p>…what he actually looks like…” Eve’s furious writing stops and she questioningly eyes Zippy.</p>

<p>“What you actually look like?…”</p>

<p>Without taking a breath she jumps into an impromptu interview.</p>

<p>“Does this mean there is an underground race of clown-men? What relation are you to the pirate? Have you tried to breed with a normal human? When was the las…”</p>

<p>She stops mid sentence and completely freezes. It seems that she is staring at something in the empty corner.</p>

<p>She utters a barely audible “No” and slinks further into the booth bringing her knees to her chest.</p>


</section>

<section data-author="duckmu">


<p>Helward jumps up from the table and stabs an accusatory finger at the clown.</p>

<p>“I knew it. You and the pirate have allied to defeat his ancient foe…the Ninja!” He yelled, shifting his eyes to Cwruidth and then back to the razor clown. “And now you’re trying to recruit more allies against the ninja mafia! You’ll never be able to take them down. They are too powerful…” He trails off as the reporter stares at the nothing.</p>

<p>Horrible realization dawned on him at that moment and as it did hundreds if not thousands of daggers flew from his hand straight at the corner. “The ninjas have a spy here already!”</p>


</section>

<section data-author="oster">


<p>The corner wrinkled, then shredded, as knives tore through the air and destroyed the false corner (which was a cleverly painted bed sheet that resembled said corner). Several dead ninja, obviously not of the professional caliber most ninja are, lay dead on the floor. But one, one stood defiantly with naught but a bar stool leg studded with knives and nary a scratch on him. The Ninja spied Cwruidth across the room and his cruel eyes hardened. Did the ninja recognize Cwruidth? Or perhaps it was merely a mutual innate hatred since the last Pirate-Ninja War of 1865. The ninja dropped the length of wood and unslung…</p>

<p>A guitar. But not just any guitar: this guitar was a blood red Jackson Rhodes said to be inhabited by the immortal soul of Guitarist Randy Rhodes. The ninja’s left hand produced a gleaming pick crafted from a turbonium dragon’s scale. With it, he proceeded to wail.</p>

<p>Hella hard.</p>


</section>

<section data-author="crwuidth">


<p>As the few remaining ninjas scattered around the ArchNinja, vanishing into various mouseholes and heating registers, the dust settled, and the view behind came into clear focus. The ArchNinja had resorted to that oldest of contingencies because he was trapped between a rock and a hard place. For behind, crashed halfway through the wall of the adjoining Cinema’s sub-sub-basement, held at bay only by the raucous sound of the shredding guitar, was a pale and long-haired boy of about sixteen with a teddy bear, standing astride an M-1 Abrahms’ Main Battle tank. And throwing his towel jauntily over one shoulder, Nicholas LeSangeur opened his fanged mouth impossibly wide and roared with enough volume to shake the bottles behind the bar: “YES! YESSSSSS!! RUN!! AND TELL YOUR MASTERS: ‘NEXT TIME, SEND MORE NINJAS!!’”</p>


</section>

<section data-author="zippy">


<p>Zippy had only a moment to react to Helward’s accusation. “What? No! I… wait, that’s what nemesis means? Oh. Then ye-“ But he was bowled over by the wave of sonic destruction unleashed by the guitar ninja.</p>

<p>The Razorclown twisted into a handspring and shoved, snapping into a tensed crouch between the reporter and the ninja. He gritted his teeth against the metal onslaught, digging his sword into the ground to gain purchase. “Solo… so… wicked…”</p>

<p>It was then that his eyes faded to pure white. His dark purple irises shrank into his coal-black pupils, which then grayed and disappeared. He gasped as the spray of black, shining, liquid tendrils burst from his heart, spinning and coiling. Before he could register his surprise, the mass - gleaming like molten hematite - slammed into shape.</p>

<p>A long-necked bass guitar, black and silver. Jagged and armored, with barbed-wire strings. The amp cable led straight into his chest.</p>

<p>Zippy’s pained grimace turned upward at the edges, into a fiece grin.</p>

<p>“I have rock powers.”</p>

<p>And his fingers attacked the fretboard, his thumb and little finger slapping a grove that would send a thousand hard rockers, capoieristas, and b-boys into conniptions. The deep foundations of the building shuddered with every downbeat. And from the Razorclown’s throat issued the most rhythmical animal growls, fusions of David Draiman and Johnathan Davis that no mortal vocal cords could dare attempt.</p>

<p>The groove demanded a guitar riff to match.</p>


</section>

<section data-author="oster">


<p>The archninjaguitarist replied, wraping a screaming, sonic onslaught of pure metal lml&gt;-&lt;lml around the vicious pulse of the razorclown’s infernal grooveline. Combined, they began to twist bass and rhythm guitar lines into a double helix of sound that would melt the very fingers of Dragonforce.</p>


</section>

<section data-author="zippy">


<p>Zippy’s eyes widened, the heart-cable crackling with energy.</p>

<p>“Help. Help! HELP! Must counterattack! Need… lead… guitar!”</p>


</section>

<section data-author="crwuidth">


<p>Staying fast to one knee, though only one pint was blood and the other four caustic ethanolites thrumming mercilessly in his veins, Cwruidth drew from his Bag of Holding a spun-glass violin, on which he began to agonizingly riff off the soprano chords of Whiskey In The Jar, not as it was played by Thin Lizzy, or even Peter Paul and Mary; but as it was played by the first highwaymen ever to be scorned by womankind. The original verse that ended with the Bold Deceiver and his brother escaping away through County Kilarney though all was lost, his very willpower warping the tides of probability, as the violin’s strings thrummed improbably to the tension-coiling, nerve-shattering tune of rigging stretched far beyond breaking by the gale, and an anchor-chain bare moments from whiplashing across a foredeck and down below the waterline…</p>


</section>

<section data-author="zippy">


<p>With a hearty laugh and a voice disturbingly like Jello Biafra’s, Zippy belted out the verse heard only in the Forgotten Realms:</p>

<p>“I hastened from the hills<br>
To the tavern in the valley,<br>
and met a goblin beggar<br>
by the name of O’Malley,</p>

<p>“He said to me, “dear master,<br>
could you spare me a copper?”<br>
The coins were all ‘o gold,<br>
so I had not one to offer!</p>

<p>“Musha riggam, du ram dah!<br>
Whack fol the daddy O!<br>
Whack fol the daddy O,<br>
there’s whiskey in the jar!”</p>


</section>

<section data-author="crwuidth">


<p>Cwruidth, swaying as the ArchNinja was insidiously drawn into the infectious tune (Because seriously, everyone loves the Irish, and the native HyperIrish from Cwruidth’s home dimension were no exception), chimed in with the appropriate next verse, as every HyperIrish boy is taught all the verses as a rite of passage when he learns his first instrument, even those only sung in parallel worlds:</p>

<p>“So i ask’d ‘im t’ go wi’ me,<br>
t’rough Cork or t’rough Poll na gCaonach*<br>
‘Cause a goblin treats ye better<br>
t’an my darlin’ sportin’ Jenny…</p>

<p>Mwuisghqk reinghjlghd meirlldwygh daidygb,**<br>
i wept for me daddy, oh:<br>
i wept for me daddy, oh:<br>
there was poitín† in th’ jar-o!</p>

<p>So we all ambushed t’ ninja<br>
an’ we bound ‘im in septan’yum<br>
t’pirate cut ‘is ‘ead off<br>
  an’ we all ‘ad a drink o’ ‘im- <strong>hell an’ a half, i can’t improvise, get ‘im!</strong>”</p>

<p>Cwruidth, dropping the fiddle, drew next from his bag a rápair‡ right quick, and leaped° screaming at the ArchNinja; his very Pirate essence bursting with nigh-genetic ancestral hate that could no longer be controlled.</p>

<footer>

<p>*Gaelic; pronounced “pull-KENNY;” the name of a place in County Cork.</p>

<p>**From old hypergaelic; pronounced “MUsha-RING-AMADO-da-ma-DA” and meaning “You shoulda seen the look on his friggin’ face, seriously the old man nearly died when he realized it wasn’t jam.”</p>

<p>†Both regular and hypergaelic; pronounced “PÜTcheen,” an ancient potato/barley moonshine native to Ireland/UberErin, which is usually between 180- and 190-proof, and which, if your father had thought was jam, would totally have killed him in the same situation, for reals. Replaces the word “Whiskey” in the HyperIrish version because it has the same number and order of stressed syllables, and because Whiskey does not exist in UberErin, since it tastes like ass.</p>

<p>‡ A little known fact, the word “rapier” in the song is actually an understandable European mishearing, the original word was in fact “rápair,” the gaelic for “spear.”</p>

<p>°Okay, i totally made that one up but seriously, i’m a linguistics student and i strongly believe we absolutely MUST be able to agree on a better spelling for something that’s pronounced “LEPT.”</p>

<p>The archninja swayed at first, momentarily mesmerized by the pirate’s song… but as the pirate roared his “get’im” the archninja shook himself out of the trance and threw a smoke bomb on the floor, vanishing from the bar in inky puff of smoke. A single sheet of loose leaf paper fluttered gently to the ground.</p>

<p>On it was a childish doodle of cwruidth, composed in crayon. It showed the pirate dead and burning, all manner of stabby things puncturing his corpse. He was surrounded by a happy throng of cheering, dancing ninjas. In japanese, a message was scrawled at the bottom.</p>

<p>“Next time, Gadget, next time.”</p>


</section>

<section data-author="crwuidth">

<p>Clapping him on the shoulder genially, Nicholas remarked, “Excellent work. i’m fairly sure you kept them here long enough to put a trace on their native cellphone signals.”</p>

  <p>The pirate spat back, “Don’ ever touch me ‘gain, or deal wi’ th’ devil or no, we’ll fin’ out ‘ow ind’struct’ble ye really arr. That lot… well, i only ‘greed t’ work wi’ ye b’cause they’re cowards.”</p>
