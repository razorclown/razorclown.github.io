      <h1>Another Ricky and Kenji Adventure!</h1>
      <p>A pass-off story, written July 3–14, 2008 on the Knoll Forum.</p>
    </header>
      <main>

  <article>

  <section data-author="zippy">

    <p>“But I don’t wanna fight the lazerninja!” said Ricky, scrambling to escape the straightjacket.</p>

    <p>“Well, you should have thought of that earlier,” Kenji said, shaking his head. “Good luck, soldier!” And he booted his friend off the platform and into the steel cage.</p>
  </section>

  <section data-author="oster">
    <p>The cage was then lowered from the safety of the watchtower into an “empty” expanse of grass. Ricky’s lip wobbled as he gripped his “chunk gun” - a boxy yellow plastic gun that shot chunks of rubber “bullets”.</p>

    <p>The grass rustled nearby… and then a voice burst out from behind Ricky.</p>

    <p>“FIRIN’ MAH LAZER!”</p>
  </section>

  <section data-author="duckmu">
    <p>“Cut!” yelled esteemed director Michael Hosengrof. “That’s not in the script!”</p>

    <p>Ricky, tired of all the interruptions, grumbled “It’s better than the line you wrote” and then louder “Why does the ninja have lasers? And I have a “chunk gun”? I don’t even know what this thing is. It looks like a NERF gun. Can we just hurry up and finish this movie so I can go home and bury my acting career?”</p>

    <p>Kenji, always the diplomat, inserted himself into the conversation in order to help make peace “Yeah, this movie is stupid. Why is he fighting the laser ninja again? It killed his sister that he didn’t know he had until just a day earlier? And she was blind? and deaf? And terminally ill? Seriously, you don’t write like you used to Michael…” Or maybe he would simply contradict the narrator. Thanks Ricky.</p>
  </section>

  <section data-author="zippy">
    <p>Crack stuntgirl Naomi Whackamole ripped off her ninja hood and scowled. “And if I <em>killed</em> his sister, how can I <em>be</em> his sister?”</p>

    <p>“Look, I am the writer-director-producer-key-grip for this picture, and my word is law!” Hosengrof fumed. He jabbed Ricky in the forehead with his forefinger. “No ad-libs! My vision! My NERF gun! PLACES!”</p>

    <p>He stomped back to his director’s chair and slumped into it. Naomi scowled even harder, and stuffed her head into the hood once again.</p>

    <p>“Hack.”</p>

    <p>Hosengrof’s eyes widened, and slowly began to glow red.</p>

    <p>“What did you call me?”</p>
  </section>

  <section data-author="cwruidth">
    <p>“A… HACK.” Naomi’s voice pronounced the words very carefully and deliberately, her once sorely mortal voice now cracked the very air like thunder, rending certain frequencies entirely, never to be heard again in creation. The sound of the two syllables was at once that of every drum that ever beat for freedom from oppression. A bright light shone from behind her with all the fury of a thousand Latin suns. In silhouette; her looming, towering form flirted with the very boundaries of perception; her eyes obscene, gaping emptiness: affronts to sanity that for all their voidness still inspired thoughts of countless hordes of unnameable, skittering nightmares. The stuntpersons’ local union had been in exceptional form this year.</p>

    <p>Accordingly Hosengrof, though not necessarily convinced, was more than adequately intimidated.</p>
  </section>

  <section data-author="zippy">
    <p>Ricky and Kenji gawked at the soon-to-be carnage. “Dude,” Ricky whispered. “We should go off script all the time.”</p>
  

    <p>Kenji nodded slowly, and surreptitiously grabbed a sandwich from the lunch cart behind him.</p>
  </section>

  <section data-author="oster">
    <p>Kenji chewed, slowed, and blinked. “Wow,” he mused. “This is pretty good.”</p>

    <p>Ricky nodded, munching on a bag of chips. “I told you there was a reason I signed us up for this… GREAT catering.”</p>

    <p>“Shhh,” Kenji muttered back absent mindedly, and the two went back to watching the circling stuntwoman-ninja and director-hack…</p>
  </section>

  <section data-author="cwruidth">
    <p>Naomi’s transformation nearly complete, the Six Chimes of Time having rung out, the sun had been blotted from the sky by the sandstorm and the hornets. As Shaa-kzaq, the name-keeper, began to stir again and stretch the aeons-dead tongue in his moldering, mummified skull. Soon. The Oldest Song, once more, and backwards, and The Waiting would finally, after all these countless ages of creation, be over.</p>

    <p>Ricky leaned over. “Okay, this rocks pretty hard, but am i the only one who gets the feeling someone should stop her like, sometime BEFORE she un-makes the universe?”</p>
  </section>

  <section data-author="zippy">
    <p>Kenji scoffed. “Come on. It’s not like <em>is that Shaa-kzaq?</em>”</p>

    <p>The name-keeper shambled onto the sound stage, dragging one dessicated leg. He threw a nod to the adventurers and pawed a handful of M&amp;Ms from their bowl. “<em>Ashhtak-kara</em>.”</p>

    <p>Kenji sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose. “Yeah, good to see you, too Zaq. Ricky, power up, would you?” He began pressing buttons on his watch, muttering to himself.</p>
  </section>

  <section data-author="duckmu">
    <p>As Kenji’s watch “beeped” and “booped” with no noticeable results he concluded that someone must have switched his watch for an identical prop watch that he had seen on set earlier. Who could have done such a thing? How would they have known about the world shattering entities present? And when was the last time the name-keeper washed his hands? Kenji really wanted some M&amp;M’s before existence was torn asunder.</p>

    <p>Ricky, on the other hand, was powering-up, thanks to implanted cybernetics. Those are hard to switch out without noticing.</p>
  </section>

  <section data-author="zero">
    <p>Jim the shoggoth wrangler return for the bath room wiping off his hands on his blood stained leather apron just in time to see the ninja glowing as hot as the sun “no were in my contract does it say anything about avatars of Nyralotheop if the world does not end expect a call form my lawyer .</p>

    <p>the black slime that just ate the lunch cart set its pseudopods on Kenji who was still searching for M&amp;Ms</p>
  </section>

  <section data-author="zippy">
    <p>Kenji scooped up a handful of black slime and froze. “That is not what M&amp;Ms feel like.”</p>

    <p>Ricky, crackling with bluenine-level power, snickered. “Yes-huh. Take a bite.”</p>

    <p>“Please don’t,” gargled the slime, opening its dripping maw to engulf Kenji.</p>

    <p>Hosengrof rose from his chair and rolled up his sleeve. On his wrist glinted Kenji’s watch, in all of its polished Ossemite glory. The director leveled the watch’s laser emitter at the swirling chaos of his lone stuntgirl. Kenji’s eyes bulged.</p>

    <p>“No, no, no!”</p>

    <p>“Oh, yes.” Hosengrof narrowed his hellish eyes and squeezed the button.</p>

    <p>The energy pulse roared from the watch, bleaching the very air and filling the studio with ions. It slammed into Naomi, flinging her from seven of the twelve planes she inhabited. Her corporeal body spun aloft, bathed in burning death. Hosengrof tilted back his head and cackled.</p>

    <p>But when he lowered his head, the laughter stopped. The stunt ninja hovered above, with energy throbbing around her. The white pulse swirled and straightened in midair, and began to turn colors.</p>

    <p>Kenji bit his lip. “Aaaand, we’ve got an Atwood Loop.”</p>

    <p>The slime very slowly released Kenji and hid behind Shaa-kzaq.</p>
  </section>

  <section data-author="cwruidth">
    <p>“No!” Tittered Hosengrof, his eyes brimming with madness, “An Atwood loop! Her own timeline shackled to my own! A director’s nightmare: ETERNAL REHEARSAL!”</p>
    
    <p>“You fool, Hosengrof!” Screeched the slime, “You’ve doomed us all!”</p>
  </section>

  <section data-author="duckmu">
    <p>“Doomed us all? Why, “doomed us all” is my middle name!…wait, no, that’s not right…maybe, “saved us all”…but no one said…“Ricky trailed off as his power levels reached maximum. Green and red bolts of energy appeared out of seemingly nowhere to strike his now shining body, only to be reflected at the various destructible objects around him.</p>

    <p>“Ahem, Ricky, the madness beasts, the Atwood loop, the crackling energy that just destroyed the director’s chair, do you think you could do something about all this instead of trying to sound heroic?” Kenji asked.</p>

    <p>It was at that moment that the “chunk gun,” previously thought a useless piece of junk, caught his eye. There appeared to be a rather large gem embedded in the gun. Either greed or the thought that maybe this gem had some magical properties to it drew Kenji towards the prop.</p>
  </section>

  <section data-author="zippy">
    <p>“Don’t do it, Kenji!” echoed Naomi from the edge of time. “I have to stop him before he makes his unlicensed sequel to Bio Zombie!”</p>

    <p>Ricky’s blazing eyes shot wide. “You sick monkey! I won’t let you ruin my favorite film!”</p>

    <p>“Trust me, stuntgirl,” said Kenji, snatching up the gun. “I know what I’m doing.” The gem was engraved, <em>If lost, please return to Jim the Shoggoth Wrangler. Right now.</em> Yes. “Ricky! Platinumzero blast on my mark! Stuntgirl! Can you shunt us to the Elemental Plane of Awesome?”</p>

    <p>A glimmer of recognition sparked in the director’s infernal eyes. “You wouldn’t,” Hosengrof snarled.</p>
  </section>

  <section data-author="duckmu">
    <p>“Oh wouldn’t I?” asked Kenji at the exact instant that all Awesome broke loose!</p>
  </section>

  <section data-author="cwruidth">
    <p>The first tremors of it were felt in the palms; that sharp, biting sting that comes from a perfect, mid-air high-five. Starting at the single, nigh-theoretical zero-point-space of the palm that is most sensitive, the portals irised fractally and the whole assembly poured into the elemental plane of awesome with the fluid grace of a centenarian surfer-yogi biting a ripcurl on the back of a great white shark… <em>and hanging ten</em>. All around spread a landscape both great and terrible, born of H.R. Giger and Hayao Miyazaki. The air hung heavy with the sound of pair upon pair of dueling electric strings: not just the wickedest axes of guitars, but the brutal tomahawks of distorted Violins and even the twin-stringed hatchets of mandolins, harmonizing with the double-neckers. Somewhere far away, but somehow as certain as faith, it could be sensed that Freddie Mercury was making sweet love to an androgynous angel, and it was perfect. The stage was set. Booming from the heavens came the voice of Tina Turner, but she spoke for every woman struck down in the name of the <em>Malleus Maleficarum</em>: “SPIN THE WHEEL, RAGGEDY MAN!!”</p>
  </section>

  <section data-author="duckmu">
    <p>The wheel spun at a near crawl, moving over each terrible and amazing misfortune that could befall the director only to land on the most terrible, most painful, and most awesome fate ever. Chuck Norris.</p>

    <p>The Texas Ranger, child friendly tooth pick clenched between rugged beard, stepped forward to deliver his judgment. It took only one word to end the struggle and restore the universe. “Hack” whispered Chuck Norris, and as it struck the director in all 29 of his souls each turned in upon itself in a frenzy of guilt and disgust. As the last soul brought about it’s own end in shame at the displeasure of the great Mr. Norris, reality settled around itself and the cast and crew found themselves once more in the studio, with the director nowhere to be found.</p>
  </section>

  <section data-author="zippy">
    <p>All was deeply silent.</p>

    <p>Ricky leaned over to Kenji. “…dude, did Chuck Norris roundhouse kick his soul?”</p>

    <p>“Shh. Don’t spoil the moment.”</p>
  </section>

  <section data-author="oster">
    <p>Rebuked, Ricky frowned but fell silent.</p>

    <p>Naomi could only stare wide eyed for a moment, mouth open. It lasted only for a moment, however, as she quickly stretched and walked away, hands behind her head. “Oh well,” she said nonchalantly “I guess there’s always the new Segal movie, Extra Curricular Justice…”</p>

    <p>Jim the Shoggoth Wrangler sniffed, tears in his eyes. “By the beard, it was beautiful.” His hand found the one belonging to the dazed stunt ninja extra next to him. “…now I can die a happy man.”</p>

    <p>Kenji merely closed his eyes and smiled serenely, enjoying the silent bliss of not-death-by-elder-god-thing.</p>

    <p>Ricky looked over, spying a bag of Peanut M&amp;M’s on the floor.</p>

    <p>“Dude, score!,” he said cheerfully grabbing the bag and then munching away.</p>

    <p>Kenji glared at him sourly. With a mouthful of deliciousness, Ricky blinked and replied around a mouthful of candy.</p>

    <p>“What?”</p>
  </section>

  <section data-author="cwruidth">
    <p>And as the “What?” was pronounced, the whole gang started laughing together as the scene froze to a tableau, then converted to a sketch drawing as the credits rolled. i think everyone learned a lesson today…</p>

    <p>STAY TUNED IN FOR NEXT TIME, VIEWERS!!</p>
