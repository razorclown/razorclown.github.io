  <p>A large quantity of crates marked as medical supplies arrive at Persephone and are promptly loaded onto the Blossom.

  <p>(From PNN, The Pandora News Network, Sector Feed)</p>

  <p>The Poseidon Group announced today that the Factory Satellite in orbit around Hephaestus suffered a catastrophic loss of all hands during the arrival of badly needed components for relief kits being shipped to victims of The Ares Consortium’s fierce war with The Locusts in the Region of Warped Space known as the Chaos Marches. The Poseidon Group has implicated the terror organization known as REMUS in such a “dispicable, heartless, and cruel act of malice”.</p>

  <p>Apparently we found the right hiding place. The moon dust must be thick enough to mask us after all. Good thing. Wouldn’t have wanted to miss this. We’ve been able to pick up their comms and get ours to and from as well. Just about perfect.</p>

  <p>My man aboard the Blossom tells me they left five minutes ago for Hephaestus. And my… man on Hephaestus tells me they’re expecting more materials today. Unbelievable. Dresden’s lost his mind if he thinks no one’s going to notice. But then again, this is Poseidon we’re talking about.</p>

  <p>[sigh] The Merovingian’s been here for three days, and it hasn’t moved. Sensors have been going nonstop, but they’re just floating there. They’re supposed to be watching Hades to make sure the Locust don’t rush the rift and make it through. They’re supposed to be watching for us.</p>

  <p>In three days, fifty Locust ships have made it through. Fifty. We don’t have sensor logs. Can’t give away our position. But we have it all on camera.</p>

  <p>And you know what? I’m gonna tape it when I twist that bastard Dresden’s head off his shoulders.</p>

  <p>[personal log of Markus Octavius Leonidus, Captain of the PGS Merovingian]</p>

  <p>We arrived in system approximately twenty hours ago, and have been on station observing The Hades Cluster. Officially, we’re watching for any Locust Slipping through the rift on the darkside of Charon. Unofficially, we’re here to watch for those Reman bastards. Poseidon’s worried that the insurgents might’ve caught wind of our true motives. But as long as we put on a good show with the Forellians, we’ve got nothing to be worried about. The crew is nervous, but they’ll do their duty. I wish such green recruits hadn’t been requisitioned from Olympus for the task, but the ambush we survived at Crete has proven their mettle. I just wish we hadn’t lost the Athena and her sensor suite.</p>

  <p>Prometheus: Son, there’s a great deal you’ve got to learn about the galaxy. You’ve been living in a cave, with only the shadows of the truth playing on the wall before you. But now I’m offering you a choice. A choice to bring a brighter, hotter light then you’ve ever known and shine it right on the people who’ve been forging your entire life with shadow puppets.</p>

  <p>Twisp: Uh…</p>
