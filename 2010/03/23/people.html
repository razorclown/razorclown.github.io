    <p>“That was incredible,” 231 said, following her back into the yard.  He looked back at the windows of the second-floor hallway where they had stood, surrounded by the images of her past.  A breeze pressed against them as they stepped outside, coming from the direction of the telepad.</p>

<p>Sophia looked behind her at the abandoned orphanage.  “Yeah,” she said.  Her eyes lingered on something, and 231 followed her gaze.  A blank spot on the wall just inside the entrance.  Or perhaps a blank spot on the floor.  As 231 looked at it, he found his attention being drawn elsewhere.</p>

<p>“Do you see something?”</p>

<p>Sophia stared a moment longer, then shook her head.  “No.”  She turned and walked toward the street.</p>

<p>231 caught up to her.  “Do you need a strong mind to do that?”</p>

<p>“The memory thing?  Yeah,” Sophia replied without a hint of pride.  “They said some psions can’t even do it.”  Her voice was nearly monotone.</p>

<p>The Goliath barely noticed her melancholy.  “That would be so useful for scouts.  Have them show the squad the terrain ahead.”</p>

<p>Turning onto the sidewalk, the girl shook her head at 231.  “You think about fighting a lot.  Is that all you think about?”</p>

<p>231 shook his head back.  “We don’t always have to fight.  Sometimes all you have to do is get ready to.”</p>

<p>Then, the question occurred to him.  “Who said that?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“That you have a strong mind?”</p>

<p>Sophia was about to answer, when she suddenly stopped walking.  Her eyes went wide and stared, her head slumping forward.</p>

<p>231 mumbled every curse he knew.  Someone important must have told her that.  Someone.</p>

<p>“It’s people.  Someone doesn’t want you to remember people.  Your friends faces.  Whoever told you you had a strong mind.”</p>

<p>She had recovered by the time the soldier had finished his thought.  She started walking again.</p>
