          <p>A group of University of Michigan graduate students have the opportunity to study a rare medieval manuscript thanks to a generous donation from a wealthy young woman.</p>
          <p>Marissa Choi, 27, offered not only to loan the university the document from her private collection, but to fund its analysis. But why this document?</p>
          <p>"It's amazing what you can learn from old books," Choi said. "When you really understand what's in there, you can understand yourself better. You can understand the whole world better."</p>
          <p>Choi's donation will allow graduate students in the Medieval and Early Modern Studies program at the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts to translate the document into modern English and analyze its content.</p>
          <p>UM did not confirm the amount of the donation, but faculty described it as "extremely generous."</p>
          <p>Professor Dan Wilmington, Ph.D. was "stunned" by Choi's donation. "Unfortunately, we don't typically see this kind of interest in historical literature," Dr. Wilmington said. "This is a thrilling opportunity for our program."</p>
          <p>The manuscript is thought to be authored in the early 14th century. "The title appears to translate to 'The Witness of the Speaker,'" Dr. Wilmington said. "I can't wait to see what's inside."</p>
          <p>Choi, who was born to Chinese immigrants in California's Central Valley, became a millionaire at a young age by investing an inheritance into her family's import/export business.</p>
