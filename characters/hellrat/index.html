                <h1>Hellrat</h1>
                <section>
    <p><strong>Name</strong>: Rrshaak<br>
        <strong>Background</strong>: Anachronistic<br>
        <strong>Power Source</strong>: Experimentation<br>
        <strong>Archetype</strong>: Physical Powerhouse<br>
        <strong>Personality</strong>: Nurturing</p>
    <p>Rrshaak and his pack* thrived in the Time-War-ravaged wastelands of 30XX, hunting lesser mutants and cobbling together discarded technology. Then, the instigators of the Time War abducted him from their future, imprisoned him in their laboratory in 2660, and mercilessly experimented on him, attempting to create new shock troops for their armies. The laboratory was attacked, the time tunnel malfunctioned, and Rrshaak was propelled into the present. The first person to see him ran away, screaming about "some kinda hell-rat," which Rrshaak thought could be a decent nickname.</p>
    <p>Rrshaak misses his pack terribly, but feels little hope that he will ever be able to return to them. He now seeks a new group to protect and provide for as he learns the ways of the early 21st century.</p>
    <p>After Rrshaak has settled into his new timeline, the Time-War Displaced Peoples Restitution Committee will approach him (see Temporal Paradox Avoidance Protocols, Section V, Chapter 12: Multiple Upstream Relocations), informing him that he cannot return to his original present, since that timeline is subject to a time-travel embargo under the Time-War Resolution Accords of 2659. They can, however, bring his pack to his current present. He agrees immediately and is reunited with his mate and their five ratlings. "After" this event, a holophoto of the reunion is prominently featured on TDPRC outreach materials.</p>
    <p><em>* "Pack" is used here for clarity: a group of quillrats is known as a "shred."</em></p>
