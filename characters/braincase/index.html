    <p><strong>Name</strong>: Ryder Thomson<br>
        <strong>Background</strong>: Struggling<br>
        <strong>Power Source</strong>: Tech Upgrades<br>
        <strong>Archetype</strong>: Blaster<br>
        <strong>Personality</strong>: Distant</p>
    <p>The mortar exploded right when Ryder Thomson sat down to tea with the warlord. One moment, he was about to negotiate a contract for Cavalry Security Solutions, and the next, he awoke in a agonizing haze, with his skull nearly shattered and severe nerve damage. When the rep from the cybernetics company offered an experimental solution to his constant pain, Ryder signed every release they put in front of him. The procedure, he later learned, was a full cranial replacement. And it was a success.</p>
    <p>Ryder's brain was transplanted into a robotic head with full human sensory capabilities. The synthetic face, however, was uncanny and unnerving — not to mention the diagnostic interface tendril extending from the base of his spine. Ryder met with constant suspicion and revulsion. No one seemed willing to trust a salesman with an inhuman face. Jobless and with no prospects, he sank into depression and slowly drained his savings. Eventually, he moved into low-income housing.</p>
    <p>There, he realized that the prejudice he faced was not as unique as he thought.</p>
    <p>Now, Ryder is learning from his neighbors. He is seeking ways to help out — including fending off villains that would prey on the neighborhood.</p>
