                <section>
    <p><strong>Name</strong>: Enlat Xaxx<br>
        <strong>Background</strong>: Interstellar<br>
        <strong>Power Source</strong>: Training<br>
        <strong>Archetype</strong>: Flyer<br>
        <strong>Personality</strong>: Alluring</p>
    <p><strong>Species</strong>: Laxennian<br>
        <strong>Gender</strong>: Kezz<br>
        <strong>Age</strong>: 41 (Earth years)<br>
        <strong>Height</strong>: 6&prime;3&Prime;<br>
        <strong>Eyes</strong>: Black<br>
        <strong>Hair</strong>: None<br>
        <strong>Skin</strong>: Blue-gray<br>
        <strong>Build</strong>: Thin for a human, burly for a Laxennian</p>
    <p>It’s true: The space rock I was born on didn’t even have a name. It was just Asteroid 225. It was my family’s job to terraform it. It was hard work, but the first time you see a sprout push out of dirt that you ground with your own hands? Amazing. And the whole time, we could just look up and see Laxennia above us and take pride that we were helping out the homeworld.</p>
    <p>And yeah, I could see when the Vrendari fleet showed up and started their bombardment. You could see the explosions. I remember, I asked my <em>kezzet</em> — oh, I guess you’d say that’s my First Mother — I asked them, “How are we gonna stop them?” And <em>kezzet</em> said to me, “However we must, <em>kezzesh</em>.”</p>
    <p>So I joined up on the day I came of age. They gave me an XR7 and a Model 14, taught me how to shoot and fly, and sent me off to free our people. And we did it. You shoulda seen it when they finally retreated. Hmm. What a sight to see.</p>
    <p>We figured out pretty quick, though, that they had other targets. Other worlds they were gonna treat like ours. When I heard people talking about going home… well, I guess I felt like I had to say something, and I guess a lot of them listened. So we went and pushed the Vrendari Empire off every world they tried to take for 37 years — that’d be, what… about… 17 Earth years? Something like that.</p>
    <p>To be honest, I hadn’t even heard of Earth before I was flying around above it. Makes quite an impression. Beautiful planet. And the people… I’m real humbled by how y’all have welcomed me. I’m just so grateful that I can retire here with my family. And I may be retired, but I promise you, I’ll do what I must to protect my city.</p>
    <p>Thank you very much.</p>
