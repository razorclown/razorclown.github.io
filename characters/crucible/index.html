                <section>
    <p><strong>Name</strong>: Kathryn O'Connor<br>
        <strong>Background</strong>: Adventurer<br>
        <strong>Power Source</strong>: Cursed<br>
        <strong>Archetype</strong>: Physical Powerhouse<br>
        <strong>Personality</strong>: Decisive</p>
    <p>Kathryn "Kitty" O'Connor was a bright young archaeology student in the early 20th century. She gained some limited notoriety when her photo appeared in a national newspaper under the headline "Girl Treasure Hunter Unearths Ancient Tomb." A later, more obscure headline about the expedition would read "Tomb Dig Ends in Disaster." Unbeknownst to the few reporters who followed the story, the expedition had awakened a vampire lord, who had singlehandedly destroyed their camp and enthralled the survivors, including Kitty.</p>
    <p>For years, Kitty — now called Katrina — served the vampire lord, addicted to his blood and dominated by his mental powers. Then, she broke free of her enthrallment and slew the vampire. She has never revealed how — only that her freedom came at great personal cost.</p>
    <p>Now, as Crucible, she hunts those undead that suborn the will of mortals. She has been touched by the magic of undeath, enhanced by it, and may be a vampire herself, at least in part. If she knows, she will not say.</p>
