                <h1>Doctor Dryad</h1>
                <section>
    <p><strong>Name</strong>: Dr. Cassiopeia Reynolds<br>
        <strong>Background</strong>: Academic<br>
        <strong>Power Source</strong>: Accident<br>
        <strong>Archetype</strong>: Elemental Manipulator<br>
        <strong>Personality</strong>: Analytical</p>
    <p>Dr. Cassiopeia Reynolds spent years researching the intersections of magic and technology. When she stumbled upon a faerie enclave of Willowsbough in England, a dryad attacked her, trying to protect its forest. The fae cursed Dr. Reynolds to transform into a tree, and her body immediately began to change. Dr. Reynolds managed to convince the fae that she meant them no harm before the transformation was complete, but the curse could not be undone. However, combining her knowledge of cybernetics with fae enchantments, she created a suit of cybernetic armor to halt the transformation. The suit channels primal nature magic through advanced electronics, preserving her life and empowering her with command over the elements.</p>
    <p>Dr. Reynolds now strives for peace between the fae and the modern world as the superhero Doctor Dryad. She also teaches introductory science seminars to the faeries of the Willowsbough Enclave, including <a href="/characters/science-fairy/">one particularly enthusaistic student</a>.</p>
