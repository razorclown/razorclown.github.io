    <p><strong>Name</strong>: Unknown<br>
        <strong>Nicknames</strong>: Bobber, Tin Can, etc.<br>
        <strong>Background</strong>: Blank Slate<br>
        <strong>Power Source</strong>: Artificial Being<br>
        <strong>Archetype</strong>: Shadow<br>
        <strong>Personality</strong>: Stalwart</p>
    <p>The robot was found in the [REDACTED] jungle with no memory of its past or purpose. Analysis suggests that it is over 1,000 years old. Its material composition, power source, cloaking device, gravity-altering properties, and [REDACTED] continue to defy explanation. Leading theories of its origin include ancient extraterrestrials and Atlantis.</p>
    <p>The robot spontaneously activated after [REDACTED]. It attempted to communicate in an unknown language upon encountering English-speaking humans, then began speaking English approximately ten minutes later. It expressed surprise at its ability to communicate thus.</p>
    <p>Since its discovery, the robot has been informally adopted by an ad-hoc superhero family in suburban [REDACTED]. It appears to have developed a mild addiction to video gaming, particularly the popular game Fortnite. The robot has reported to its roommates that it is searching its own systems for functionality, and that functions are appearing with names that are, quote, "awkwardly translated" into English (see examples below, indicated with brackets.).</p>
    <p>Further observation recommended.</p>

    <h2>Principles</h2>
    <h3>Amnesia</h3>
    <p><em>Your past is lost to you or otherwise obscured. Others have immense difficulty in keeping track of you.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Action</strong>: Overcome with Max in a situation where a completely fresh perspective is useful. Hero points all around.</p>
    <p><strong>Minor twist</strong>: You have a flash of your former life that momentarily distracted you — what was it?</p>
    <p><strong>Major twist</strong>: A shocking detail of your past changes the current situation — how does it affect the scene?</p>
    <h3>Strength</h3>
    <p><em>You are very strong, so you must be careful not to crush delicate things. You do not need to roll to perform mundane acts of great strength.</em></p>
