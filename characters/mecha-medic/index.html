    <p><strong>Name</strong>: Tyrese Lafontaine<br>
        <strong>Background</strong>: Medical<br>
        <strong>Power Source</strong>: Powered Suit<br>
        <strong>Archetype</strong>: Transporter<br>
        <strong>Personality</strong>: Fast Talker<br>
        <strong>Description</strong>: Fit African-American man, clean-shaven, very short hair, usually grinning, tired eyes.</p>
    <p>Tyrese Lafontaine is living the dream.</p>
    <p>Like many, he loved superhero comics and mecha anime from an early age. Unlike most, those fandoms shaped his character and his career path. He attended engineering school, specializing in high-precision interfaces for large machines, and started working as an EMT.</p>
    <p>When Hermes Medical Technologies began developing a powered armor suit for first responders, he followed the project obsessively. Between the official updates and patent filings, he discovered some oversights in their apparent design. He assembled a package of notes and recommendations and submitted it to Hermes. They responded with a job offer.</p>
    <p>Tyrese proved not only to be a brilliant engineer, but an ideal pilot for the prototype armor and the Hermes-3 Rapid Response Platform hover ambulance. The test runs have been very encouraging.</p>

    <h2>Principles</h2>
    <h3>Gearhead</h3>
    <p><em>You always know the general state of repair or function of an item of technology, whether it’s a simple toaster or an alien orbital defense system.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Action</strong>: Overcome a technological challenge with Max. Hero points for all.</p>
    <p><strong>Minor Twist</strong>: What mechanical device just shorted out?</p>
    <p><strong>Major Twist</strong>: What machine just went terribly off the rails?</p>
    <h3>Speed</h3>
    <p><em>You’re fast, and you don’t like to waste time. You like to be on your way as quickly as possible.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Action</strong>: When you successfully Overcome, you may end up anywhere in the current environment. Hero points for all.</p>
    <p><strong>Minor Twist</strong>: What physical drawbacks do you suffer from going too fast?</p>
    <p><strong>Major Twist</strong>: What critical detail did you speed by earlier that is now coming back to haunt you?</p>
