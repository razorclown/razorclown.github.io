    <p><strong>Name</strong>: Jackson Cassidy<br>
        <strong>Background</strong>: Tragic<br>
        <strong>Power Source</strong>: Nature<br>
        <strong>Archetype</strong>: Elemental Manipulator<br>
        <strong>Personality</strong>: Nurturing<br>
        <strong>Description</strong>: Long, dark brown hair; often fights bare-chested, displaying the runes tattooed and scarred into his arms and torso.</p>
    <p><em><a href="/characters/coalfire-villain/">See Coalfire's villain sheet</a></em></p>
    <p><em>This character is inspired by the outstanding</em> <a href='https://www.oldgodsofappalachia.com/'>Old Gods of Appalachia</a> <em>podcast (and upcoming RPG).</em></p>
    <p>No two ways about it — the Cassidy family was cursed.</p>
    <p>They say it started back in Kentucky during a mining disaster, when old Julius Cassidy was so afraid to die that he cried out for any god or demon to save him, didn't matter who. And something answered. He alone survived the underground flames and emerged from the mineshaft carrying soot and coal dust with him — along with something much darker still.</p>
    <p>It wasn't long before old Julius was running after every witch and wise woman in the hills to free him from the pact he had made with that voice in the darkness. There was only one that agreed to help him, and she warned that the only ritual that could save him came with great risk. She invoked the oldest spirits of the forest to do battle with the holder of the pact.</p>
    <p>When the working was over, the Cassidy homestead had burned to the ground. No one ever found out how the fire started, or why the charred remains of those unidentified bodies rotted away so quickly, because the Cassidys had left Kentucky before the embers had even cooled.</p>
    <p>It was 1930 when they made their way west, and if it seemed like blight and drought followed them, surely it was just a coincidence.</p>
    <p>Their fortunes turned around in California, though. A couple generations of the Cassidy boys worked for the railroads or the chemical plants without any major misfortune.</p>
    <p>Then, young Jackson found the old trunk in his uncle's attic and put on the old miner's helmet he found. When he went outside to show his father, a few motes of coal dust shook loose, drifted down, and met the earth. And that was all it took.</p>
    <p>When the superheroes found him, he stood surrounded by the blackened husks of buildings. He wore darkness and flames like a cloak. He was lost in rage and grief and emotions not his own. It took strong magic to subdue him, for the light in his eyes to subside, for him to return to himself. He asked where his family was, and it was a while before anyone had the heart to tell him.</p>
    <p>It took a set of magic runes engraved into his flesh to contain the warring powers within him. It took relentless training and discipline to learn to control them. Now, he wonders if he might just be able to use his curse for good.</p>
