    <p><strong>Name</strong>: Furkan Çelik<br>
        <strong>Approach</strong>: Prideful<br>
        <strong>Archetype</strong>: Predator<br>
        <strong>Description</strong>: Light brown skin, immaculately groomed, intense brown eyes, fashionable clothes. In his Olympian aspect: Skin like the night sky, eyes like stars. Dark purple and black toga.</p>
    <p><strong>Health</strong>: 30 + 5 × Number of heroes</p>
    <p>Dr. Çelik didn't know it would be his last dig; if he had, he might not have brought his infant son. When the team discovered the temple and the perfectly preserved artifacts therein, they were too busy celebrating to notice the winged figure approaching them. The hired security managed to mortally injure Nemesis before they were struck down, so that when Nyx herself arrived, the only person left alive was little Furkan, crying in his playpen.</p>
    <p>Nyx had lost another Nemesis, but at least she had a replacement.</p>
    <p>She raised the boy in the Underworld, introducing him to the Olympians only after she had trained him to fight and imbued him with Cthnoic power. She was patient, but not kind, and her adopted son learned to be likewise. In time, he mastered the whip that Nyx had braided from the hair of Cerberus and the griffin wings that she grafted onto him. Now, he takes revenge on those who oppose the gods — at least, those who the Goddess of Night directs him to.</p>
