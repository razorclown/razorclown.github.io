    <p><strong>Name</strong>: Maisie Collins<br>
        <strong>Background</strong>: Performer<br>
        <strong>Power Source</strong>: Genetic<br>
        <strong>Archetype</strong>: Psychic<br>
        <strong>Personality</strong>: Jovial</p>
    <p>From birth, Maisie Collins' skin was bright pink and her hair green. In her own words, she "had more of the Mutant experience than the Black experience." Her natural charisma helped her navigate the prejudice and distrust she faced, until she was outed as a psychic in her teen years. Maisie started a vlog discussing the painful experiences that followed, which quickly gained a following and became a hub of mutual support for Mutant youth. When veteran heroes also took notice and reached out to her, Maisie invited them to guest on her show; her interview series made her a genuine celebrity.</p>
    <p>Maisie is trying her best not to be swept up in her sudden fame. She genuinely wants to help people — but more than that, she can't escape the feeling that what she's doing is somehow <em>important</em>. Maisie's precognitive abilities sometimes show her flashes, moments of a future in the midst of… revolution? Invasion? Whatever these images mean, they are of a world in need of the kind of unity she strives to create.</p>
