    <p><strong>Name</strong>: Koro-Da'lith, Clan Akethiit<br>
        <strong>Background</strong>: Retired<br>
        <strong>Power Source</strong>: Supernatural<br>
        <strong>Archetype</strong>: Speedster<br>
        <strong>Personality</strong>: Lone Wolf</p>
    <p><strong>Species</strong>: Dumokari<br>
        <strong>Gender</strong>: Female<br>
        <strong>Age</strong>: 54, based on her birth date. Unknown, based on her subjective experience.<br>
        <strong>Height</strong>: 5&prime;9&Prime;<br>
        <strong>Eyes</strong>: Dark red<br>
        <strong>Hair</strong>: None<br>
        <strong>Skin</strong>: Khaki, scaled, scarred<br>
        <strong>Build</strong>: Athletic, muscled</p>
    <p>Warfleet Commander Koro-Da'lith, Clan Akethiit, was joyfully, bombastically aggressive, even for a Dumokari. She led the <em>Vandal Queen</em> and its crew to victory against the Laxennians at first, then the Vrendari, all while fighting the many space monsters that threatened the empire. Then, at the Battle of Earth, Koro-Da'lith sacrificed her ship to protect <a href="/characters/star-soldier/">Enlat Xaxx, the Star Soldier</a>, from a Vrendari superlaser strike. She was gravely wounded and forced to retire from battle, albeit as a hero. In her retirement, Koro traveled throughout the Dumokari empire, insisting that she was scouting for new threats (while quietly enjoying exploring the mysteries of space).</p>
    <p>During her explorations, she detected an unexplained spacial anomaly. When she went to investigate, her ship suddenly vanished from all scanners. A lengthy search turned up nothing; in fact, one of the search vessels also disappeared without explanation.</p>
    <p>Years later, a message arrived from a colony on the opposite side of the galaxy: Koro-Da'lith had returned, and she was changed.</p>
    <p>Her body was healed. Her scales were paler than they had been. She was unaware of how long she had been gone. She explained — cooly, without her famous swagger — that she had been in a battle of wills with an entity that could warp reality itself. And now, so could she. The battle, however, had taxed her sense of self, the core of her identity; she was now stoic, muted. Passionless. Of all these revelations, those closest to her were most disturbed by the change to her personality.</p>
    <p>Extensive examination revealed unusual patterns to her superpowers. Her mind-control abilities did not register as psionic activity. Her enhanced toughness and ability to alter her body did not appear to affect her metabolism. And her super-speed appeared not to be rapid movement, but time dilation.</p>
    <p>Now, Koro-Da'lith searches for clues to the nature of the entity she fought, protecting the galaxy from supernatural threats along the way. She senses that <a href="/characters/devaloka/">others may have been touched by similar reality-warping energies</a>, and that the universe itself may soon be threatened. And as she journeys, she quietly tries to rekindle the passion for life that once drove her.</p>
