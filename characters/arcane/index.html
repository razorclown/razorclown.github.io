    <p><strong>Name</strong>: Julian Wellesley<br>
        <strong>Background</strong>: Upper Class<br>
        <strong>Power Source</strong>: Mystical<br>
        <strong>Archetype</strong>: Armored<br>
        <strong>Personality</strong>: Jovial</p>
    <p>Despite his posh, privileged upbringing, Julian Wellesley has been remarkably level-headed from a young age. He also demonstrated impressive study skills when he began independent studies after a brief stint in boarding school which Julian's parents try not to mention. From his tutors, however, Julian received such good marks that his parents let him choose his own courses of study.</p>
    <p>Naturally, given such an opportunity, Julian sought out and hired the best teachers of the mystic arts. And since his parents have not specifically asked if he is studying to become a wizard, he has not informed them. Neither have they asked whether he is the costumed superhero Arcane. He is.</p>
