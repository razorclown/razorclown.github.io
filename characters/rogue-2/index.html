                <h1>Rogue (Annie LeBeau)</h1>
                <section>
    <p><strong>Name</strong>: Antoinette LeBeau<br>
        <strong>Nicknames</strong>: Annie, Lil Bit, Miscreant (that one was Uncle Hank's idea)<br>
        <strong>Background</strong>: Unremarkable<br>
        <strong>Power Source</strong>: Mutant (Higher Power)<br>
        <strong>Archetype</strong>: Close Quarters Combat<br>
        <strong>Personality</strong>: Mischievous</p>
    <p><strong>Height</strong>: 5&prime;5&Prime;<br>
        <strong>Eyes</strong>: Glowing pink irises, black sclera<br>
        <strong>Hair</strong>: Brown, straight<br>
        <strong>Clothing</strong>: Frequently wears mama's old bomber jacket</p>
    <p><em>I love the kid-from-an-alternatve-future trope, especially in Marvel Comics. I also love Gambit and Rogue. This character is a tribute to both.</em></p>
    <p>It's a miracle that little Annie LeBeau was born at all.</p>
    <p>Her parents had died and come back, been brainwashed and recovered, and almost been erased from the timestream so many times that they retired from the X-Men pretty young. The injuries were already starting to pile up anyway, especially after that final confrontation with Apocalypse.</p>
    <p>Annie's parents-to-be settled down on some acreage in Mississippi, hosting the old team when they came to town, but otherwise living the quiet life. But when they found a treatment that would suppress Anna Marie's powers long enough for her to carry a child to term, she and Remy decided to take on the adventure they thought they never could.</p>
    <p>After the baby was born, the old team came to town a lot more often. Little Annie learned all about the X-Men's adventures from her aunts and uncles, along with how to take care of herself in a fight. Mama and daddy made sure of it — they knew how fragile a quiet life was for a family of mutants.</p>
    <p>Annie trained in staff techniques with daddy and carefully figured out her powers with mama. Turns out she had her mama's draining touch, but could control it. (Mama cried with joy for a whole day.) She could turn the energy she absorbed into explosive force, which she shot straight out of her body. (Daddy pretended to be jealous, but he was just proud.) She couldn't fly or steal people's powers, though. (Annie cried all afternoon about that, but she got over it.)</p>
    <p>Even so, when Apocalypse came back to get revenge, there wasn't much they could do. He had already taken down enough of the heroes that mama and daddy had to use their last resort: a one-use time-travel device. They sent Annie back in time just before the shockwave hit.</p>
    <p>Annie was shook up for a bit, but she got her footing in the past pretty quick. She had time to stop Apocalypse and save her family, and she knew she'd have plenty of help. After all, she had all kinds of people waiting to meet her in this timeline — they just didn't know it yet.</p>
