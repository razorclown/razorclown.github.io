                <section>
    <p><strong>Name</strong>: Heather, Clan Willowsbough<br>
        <strong>Background</strong>: Otherworldly<br>
        <strong>Power Source</strong>: Training<br>
        <strong>Archetype</strong>: Sorcerer<br>
        <strong>Personality</strong>: Inquisitive</p>
    <p>The pixie called Heather is an enthusiastic student of <a href="/characters/dr-dryad/">Dr. Cassiopeia Reynolds</a>, a scientist who stumbled upon a faerie enclave in a forest in England. A dryad, trying to protect the forest, cursed Dr. Reynolds to become a tree. When Dr. Reynolds convinced the fae that she meant them no harm, they helped her enchant a suit of cybernetic armor to prevent her further transformation, leading her to become the superhero Dr. Dryad. The fae were so fascinated by Dr. Reynolds' scientific approach, the doctor offered to give lectures on it. Heather was the first to sign up.</p>
    <p>From the first class in the enchanted meadow, Heather was enraptured. She wove herself a tiny labcoat and fashioned smart-looking eyeglasses. She commissioned a set of beakers and vials from the clan glassblower. And she read every scientific document Dr. Reynolds recommended — and a few from more dubious sources. Her mystical nature gives her an unusual perspective on science and technology, and magic frequently leaks into her "experiments." In some ways, she is more of a science fan than a true researcher, but she learns quickly, and her controls are gradually becoming more rigorous.</p>
