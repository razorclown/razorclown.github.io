    <p><strong>Name</strong>: Jen Tanaka<br>
        <strong>Background</strong>: Academic<br>
        <strong>Power Source</strong>: Extradimensional<br>
        <strong>Archetype</strong>: Shadow<br>
        <strong>Personality</strong>: Inquisitive</p>
    <p>Alone in the lab, Jen gawked at the electron microscope scans. This microbe was weird. So many inert structures that, with the slightest mutation, would turn it into a super-deadly, super-contagious pathogen. This thing was a time bomb. Thank God she found it at this stage.</p>
    <p>"All right, little buddy," she mumbled at the screen. "Let's figure out how to keep you from hurting people."</p>
    <p>"Yeah, please don't do that," came a vast, resonant voice from inches behind her.</p>
    <p>Jen squawked in terror and hopped onto the desk, turning to face—</p>
    <p>"Oh, right, um… <em>be not afraid</em>," said the towering angel, its black and gold armor glinting with an unseen light, its razor-edged scythe held casually in one massive hand.</p>
    <p>A thin, animal noise wheezed from Jen's open mouth.</p>
    <p>The angel sighed. Jen felt the sound in her bowels. "So, that," the angel said, pointing to the rendering on the computer screen, "is going to be the plague that ushers in the end times. Eventually. It was supposed to… how did you even find it?"</p>
    <p>"I was looking for pathogen precursors! Cells that don't cause disease but might in the future! It's the subject of my dissertation!" Jen shouted in bursts.</p>
    <p>"Of course." The angel shook its head, clearly annoyed. "Okay, look, just leave that one alone, okay? Don't mess with it. Do your paper or whatever about something else."</p>
    <p>Something in Jen's gut went cold. "But," she started, surprising herself, "but I can't just… my whole goal is to prevent a pandemic! That's the point! God made me for this!"</p>
    <p>She didn't know how deeply she believed it until she yelled it at the Angel of Death.</p>
    <p>The angel threw up its muscled arms. "Well, God made <em>me</em> for <em>this</em>! And I've been working on it for way longer! And I'm not the Angel of Death. That's not a thing! Okay, you know what—" And the angel lifted its scythe in both hands.</p>
    <p>Jen found herself more bemused that the angel had read her mind than afraid that it was winding up to reap her. She wondered for a moment if anyone would pick up her research before she realized that she was still alive and the angel was… pronouncing something?</p>
    <p>"…deputized in the name of the Light to serve the Divine Will until you are released from your duties, amen. Okay, great. Your assignment is to not write your thing about that." Once again, it pointed to the screen.</p>
    <p>Jen looked at the image of the microbe. The screen bobbed below her. She was hovering on black-feathered wings. The giant scythe in her hands felt light and natural. The Light flowed through her, along with waves of smoky darkness, both pulsing with unearthly power.</p>
    <p>The angel was strolling toward the lab's exit.</p>
    <p>Jen tried to fly after it, but tumbled to the floor in a heap. "Wait! What am I supposed to do now?" She heaved herself up, leaning on the scythe like a crutch.</p>
    <p>The angel shrugged. "I dunno. Go be a superhero for all I care." And it left.</p>
