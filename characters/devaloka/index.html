    <p><strong>Name</strong>: Sanjay "Jay" Mondal<br>
        <strong>Background</strong>: Academic<br>
        <strong>Power Source</strong>: Relic<br>
        <strong>Archetype</strong>: Robot/Cyborg<br>
        <strong>Personality</strong>: Sarcastic<br>
        <strong>Description</strong>: Shaved head; short, perfectly trimmed beard; dark, unblinking eyes; small, wry smile.</p>
    <p>People say I look distant now. I gotta laugh at that. When this all started, I wanted to bring everyone together.</p>
    <p>I'm not gonna give you the full pitch, but I had this idea. The root of so many conflicts comes down to one thing: energy scarcity. If energy were cheap and affordable for everyone, we'd have one less thing to fight over. I started researching free energy, and, well, it was disappointing. All the perpetual motion machines and zero-point energy devices were obviously fake. They're all based on principles that just don't work with the laws of our universe. But then I thought, what if there were energy outside our universe, in places where those laws don't apply?</p>
    <p>I looked for inspiration in religion, metaphysics, fringe science. Then, I met Dave Cheung. He was pioneering research into pulling energy from other places. Other dimensions, other planes of existence. And he was getting somewhere. So, I founded Next Energy Solutions and made him our head scientist.</p>
    <p>Sorry, said I wouldn't do the pitch. Short version: In a couple years, we had a prototype. A working prototype. But it was dangerous. At the time, I thought it was just warping the building around it somehow, making the matter around it fluid or something.</p>
    <p>…I dunno, I might have gone ahead with the demo even if I knew what the device was actually doing. I was Founder and CEO, right? I had to show the investors that the technology was viable. I had to show them it was safe. So, I was the one to put on the suit and went into the conduction chamber.</p>
    <p>What happened next… here's my theory. In the place we had tapped into, force of will is a physical force. Your intent, your desire can determine your position, your mass — and not just your own. It's more of a natural force than gravity. And I really, really wanted that demo to work. I think that's the only reason I survived.</p>
    <p>It might also be why the suit fused with my body on, well… a conceptual level. Whatever the reason, thank God it did; it's the only reason I can keep one foot here and one foot there. Because of it, I can take a step inside and keep existing. I really don't want to take more than a step, though. I can't really talk about it, but… there are entities in there. Beings with enough force of will that… yeah, I can't talk about it.</p>
    <p>But I can do my part to keep this reality safe.</p>
