I've had a few blogs along the way. This is the latest.

Thing is, this blog has my thoughts on what has been the most revolutionary time in my life thus far. I've gone through more pain and transformation in the last few years than any that have come before. And that's saying something.

I'll talk about my own discomfort and where it's led me. I'll be more transparent than I think I need to be. I'll talk about insecurities that have crippled me for years and, therefore, need to be brought to light.

That's really what this blog is about: me bringing my own life to light.

And, you know, whatever other nonsense wanders through my brain.
