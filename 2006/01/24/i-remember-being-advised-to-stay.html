    <p>I remember being advised to stay within the lines when I was coloring as a child.  It’s not like anyone was trying to limit my creativity; it’s just that if you don’t stay within the lines, the picture is totally incoherent at the end.  The lines blur under patches of color, and the image becomes something else.</p>

<p>Today, we in the modern West are presented with an increasingly abstract image.  Long-familiar lines have become blurred and obscured.</p>

<p>The line between life and death – should it not be clear? – is disturbingly ambiguous.  Medical technology permits us to prolong a failing pulse… indefinitely?  How alive is the comatose woman, devastated by a car accident a decade ago, sustained only by life support?  And who decides when to turn off the machines?  Somewhere, there is a line between life and unlife, but where?  As a nation, we still cannot agree on whether a pregnant mother carries within her an unborn child, or merely a fetus.  The difference cannot be overemphasized.</p>

<p>Gender lines have been drawn and redrawn.  A thousand maps exist, a thousand theories on who is who and why.  I told a friend that I’d never met a transgender person, and she told me that I had, naming them.  That, I realized, was why I’d had a problem figuring out whether they were male or female: they were in-between.  Even for those who remain in their natural sex, gender roles are continually rejected and recast.  Homosexuality moves into the mainstream, and the questions continue to pile up.  What happens to parenting, or romance, or family, when male and female are all but interchangeable?</p>

<p>The private blurs more and more into the public.  People worry about the prevalence of surveillance technology, the constant monitoring and tracking of their day to day lives.  They then proceed to post deeply personal information – thoughts, gripes, vendettas – on the Internet.  (I am sharply aware that this blog is accessible by a startling number of people throughout the world, but it seems that many bloggers are not.)  While on the Internet, they can easily find descriptions, pictures, and video of the most explicit and intimate personal acts imaginable.  Sex and more.  This trend is reflected not only in the dark (and light) corners of the Internet, but in practically every other form of mass media.  Is it permissiveness, or openness?</p>

<p>Truth and falsehood slip increasingly into obscurity.  Spiritual beliefs have been assigned their own corner of reality: they cannot be right or wrong.  Everyone believes what they believe, and everyone is right.  Even if their beliefs contradict.  I posed this question to a friend: if she didn’t believe in trucks, would she die if a truck hit her?  “No,” she said.  I hope she was an extreme example.</p>

<p>Change is afoot.</p>

<p>And the price?  Confusion, at least, and on any number of levels.  Loss of innocence.  Some of our social experiments, I think, shall fail.  All that remains to be seen is which, and how badly.  Some, however will be great boons to society.  I am cautiously optimistic about the advent of the blog, and the idea of bringing wide scale publishing to the masses.  I think a certain level of openness on the subject of sexuality is quite healthy.</p>

<p>But when I read in the first chapter of Genesis about the Earth being formless and covered in darkness, I think of a world with no lines, no boundaries.  Everything is permitted, supposedly.  But the Holy Spirit still hovers over the face of the waters, eagerly awaiting the day when the darkness will be utterly removed, and the lines that have always been there will be undeniably clear.</p>

<p>Because in the end, some lines cannot be erased by man.</p>
